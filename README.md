# REBYU

An adaptive certification-review platform. Learners study a structured
curriculum, sit assessments that are graded per question type, and get a study
plan and a priority order built from what a Bayesian model believes they
actually know. Institutions buy seats for their learners; admins author the
curriculum, the question bank and the assessments behind it.

## What it does

**Curriculum.** A certification holds major categories, modules and lessons.
Lessons are authored block by block — headings, lists, images, video, tabs,
accordions, flip cards — in a three-pane editor.

**Assessments.** Diagnostic, lesson quiz, middle and major unit exams, mock
exam, plus two authoring-time types. Every attempt snapshots its questions, so
a paper cannot change under a learner mid-attempt. Question types:

| Type | Graded by |
| --- | --- |
| Multiple choice | exact match |
| Short answer | accepted variations |
| Descriptive | rubric |
| Programming | Judge0, against test cases |
| Diagram | structural comparison with a reference diagram |

Retaking a normal exam rebuilds the paper adaptively, weighted toward the
learner's weakest (lesson, difficulty) cells. Challenge arenas are exempt — an
arena *is* its problem set.

**Adaptive model.** A FastAPI service runs Bayesian Knowledge Tracing over
answered questions, maintaining a mastery probability per lesson and a priority
tag (critical → strong) that drives what the platform recommends next. Mastery
moves with answered questions, not with lessons read. Reported mastery is
capped near observed accuracy, so a short correct streak cannot read as
mastered on untrained parameters.

**Study plans.** One plan spans whichever enrolled certifications a learner
picks, each with its own start and target exam date. It schedules three
techniques as dated activities: Active Recall (assembled as a RECALL exam),
Pomodoro, and SM-2 spaced repetition.

**Challenges.** Three arenas — CodeStrike (programming), Blueprint Arena
(diagrams) and World Cup. An admin configures each arena's problems and the
industries allowed in; arenas with no problems stay locked for learners.

**Institutions.** Organisations buy certificate seats, invite learners, group
them, and track progress. Partnership requests are reviewed by an admin.

## Running it

The application services and their brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis) run under Docker
Compose. The database (Supabase Postgres) and the vector store (Qdrant Cloud)
are hosted; their URLs and keys live in `backend-java/.env` and
`python-backend/.env`, which Compose reads.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| Java API | http://localhost:8080 |
| Adaptive service | http://localhost:8000 |
| RabbitMQ console | http://localhost:15672 |

Rebuild a service after changing its source — the images are built, not
mounted:

```bash
docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d frontend
```

For a deployment outside the local Compose stack, pass the public API origin
at build time. Vite embeds this value in the static bundle; setting it only in
the running nginx container is too late:

```bash
docker build --build-arg VITE_API_URL=https://backend-production-20f5.up.railway.app -t rebyu-frontend ./frontend
```

### Configuration

Each service reads its own `.env`, which is **not** in version control:

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `backend-java/.env` | database URL, Cognito pool and client, Judge0 |
| `python-backend/.env` | database URL, broker URL, BKT parameters and thresholds |
| `frontend/.env` | API base URLs |

Copy the matching `.env.example` where one exists and fill in the values.

## Notes for contributors

**Flyway does not run.** Migrations under `resources/db/migration` are inert —
the Boot 4 module is absent. JPA entities with `ddl-auto: update` are the only
schema authority. Change the entity, not a migration.

**Icons are generated.** `frontend/src/components/icons.tsx` is produced from a
map; edit the map and run `npm run icons` rather than the file itself.

**The database is remote.** Supabase Postgres in ap-southeast-1 — the first request
after an idle period pays a cold start of a few seconds. Batch reads across a
list rather than issuing one query per row.
