"""Marking one written answer.

Java owns everything about the attempt -- which questions were asked, what
each is worth, whether the item is pending -- and asks this service exactly
one question: how many of these points did this answer earn, and why. See
`com.capstone.rebyu.assessment.service.AssessmentAttemptService`.

Two rules shape the whole module.

**The model judges, the code scores.** The agent returns a percentage and a
sentence of feedback; every number Java persists is computed here from that
percentage against `maxPoints`, then clamped and rounded. A model asked to do
decimal arithmetic against a 7.5-point question gets it wrong occasionally and
invisibly, and "occasionally and invisibly" is the worst possible failure mode
for a mark on a learner's transcript.

**A missing verdict is never a zero.** Anything that stops a real judgement --
an exhausted model chain, a malformed response, a sub-question the model
skipped -- raises. Java's caller already treats a failure as "leave it
unmarked" and retries; inventing a 0 here would hand a learner a mark nobody
made. The one exception is a blank submission, which is a real 0 that needs no
model at all.
