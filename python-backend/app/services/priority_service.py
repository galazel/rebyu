    """The knowledge estimate, held within reach of the learner's actual record.

    BKT's P(L) answers "what is the chance they know this *now*", and it is
    recency-weighted by design: Bulut et al. (2023), Eq. 3 -- each observation
    updates the posterior and then applies the learn transition, so a run of
    correct answers is *supposed* to move it sharply. That is the right
    behaviour for a learner who has turned a corner, and the wrong one to put
    on a dashboard unqualified: with the untrained fallback parameters, three
    correct answers took a real learner to 0.98 on a lesson they had answered
    19 right and 70 wrong. No reading of that record supports 98%.

    So once there is enough evidence to be worth trusting, observed accuracy
    sets a ceiling on what is *reported*. The headroom above accuracy is
    deliberate rather than slack -- a learner who has genuinely improved should
    read higher than their lifetime average, because that average still carries
    everything they have since learned. What they cannot do is read as mastered
    on the strength of the last three answers alone.

    Applied here, at the point of reporting, and never written back to
    `LearnerLessonMastery`: the stored value is the input to the next update
    (`mastery_before`), so capping it would feed a doctored prior into the
    chain and compound at every step. The model stays the model; this is a
    statement about what we are willing to *claim*.

    Once per-lesson parameters are actually fitted this guard should bind far
    less often, and its headroom is worth revisiting then -- it is a safeguard
    against untrained parameters, not a permanent part of the model.
