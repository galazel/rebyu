"""Writes generated questions and exams into Java's assessment schema.

Until now the certification graph generated major/middle/lesson quizzes, a
diagnostic exam, a mock exam, and a 100-question bank -- and then discarded

every quiz and exam an admin approved existed solely inside a LangGraph
checkpoint and was invisible to the learner app, the adaptive retake
