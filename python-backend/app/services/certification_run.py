"""Executing a certification run, and recovering one that failed.

Everything after `graph.ainvoke` -- persisting the curriculum, saving the
generated assessments, marking the generation request, notifying the admin --
used to live inside the RabbitMQ consumer. That made the consumer the only
thing that could finish a run, so a failure had exactly one remedy: publish a
new message. Re-publishing does not help, because the new message reuses
`thread_id = str(generation_request_id)` and LangGraph picks the *existing*
checkpoint back up, landing on the same failed step with the same inputs.

So the run outcome handling lives here, and two recovery paths use it:

*Retry* re-runs only the step that failed. LangGraph checkpoints after every
superstep, so a node that raised leaves the thread parked with that node still
pending -- invoking with `None` re-executes exactly it, keeping everything the
run has already produced. A ~2.5 minute document ingestion is not repeated to
retry the 40-second curriculum call that failed after it.

*Restart* throws the run's checkpoints away and begins at step one with a
freshly rebuilt seed. That is the answer when the state itself is the problem
and no amount of re-running one node will help.

Both keep the run's `thread_id`, so the registry timeline, the generation
request, and any websocket client stay attached to the same run.
