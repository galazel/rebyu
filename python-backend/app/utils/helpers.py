    A single long-lived connection (the previous implementation) has no way
    to recover once the server drops it -- a managed Postgres suspending its
    compute on idle (Neon's default behavior), a network blip, a restart,
    anything. Every checkpoint read/write after that fails with the same
    `OperationalError: server closed the connection unexpectedly` for the
    rest of the process's life, which is exactly what took the tutor down:
    one dropped connection turned into a permanent outage until redeploy.

    A pool borrows a fresh connection per operation and health-checks it
    first (`check=AsyncConnectionPool.check_connection`), so a dead
    connection gets quietly replaced instead of failing every request behind
    it. `AsyncPostgresSaver` accepts a pool directly in place of a raw
    connection -- see `langgraph.checkpoint.postgres._ainternal.get_connection`,
    which already branches on `isinstance(conn, AsyncConnectionPool)`.

    The lock matters: without it two concurrent first-requests can both see
    `None` and each open their own pool, leaking one of them.
