"""Deterministic quality checks over a generated question batch.

The Phase 2 brief asks for AI validation detecting "duplicate questions,
incorrect answers, missing explanations, hallucinations, poor distractors,
formatting issues, objective alignment problems, Bloom's taxonomy
inconsistencies, and difficulty imbalance".

Most of those are decidable *without* another model call, which makes them
free, instant, and deterministic. Doing them here means the LLM-based checks
that remain can focus on the genuinely semantic questions.

Everything in this module is a pure function over plain data.
