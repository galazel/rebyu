"""Pure mapping from generated content onto Java's assessment schema.

The hard constraint this module exists to solve: `questions.lesson_id` is
NOT NULL in Java's schema, so *every* question must belong to exactly one
lesson. But most generated artifacts deliberately span many lessons -- a
major-category quiz covers everything under that category, and the mock exam
and question bank cover the whole certification.

So each question has to be resolved to a concrete lesson. The generator
emits `lesson_ref` (a lesson *name*) for exactly this purpose; this module
turns that into a lesson id, and decides what to do when it can't.

No I/O here -- callers pass in the lesson lookup and receive plain rows.
