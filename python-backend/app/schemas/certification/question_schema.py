#: Canonical difficulty vocabulary. HARD, not DIFFICULT.
#:
#: This used to say DIFFICULT while `mastery.py` said HARD, and the two were
#: never reconciled -- so generation wrote DIFFICULT into `questions`, and the
#: Java side (`BktEventFactory.KNOWN_DIFFICULTY`, which knows only EASY/
#: AVERAGE/HARD) then silently collapsed every one of those to its AVERAGE
#: fallback. The effect was not a cosmetic duplicate: hard questions were
#: reported to BKT as average ones, so guess/slip were fitted against the
#: wrong difficulty class.
Difficulty = Literal["EASY", "AVERAGE", "HARD"]

#: Accepted spellings that are normalised to a canonical value. DIFFICULT is
#: kept as an alias rather than rejected because it is what the prompts asked
#: for until now: existing drafts still carry it, and a model told "HARD" will
#: still occasionally answer "DIFFICULT". Silently correcting it is better
#: than failing a whole generation over a synonym.

#: Four was a hard requirement, which made one whole class of professional exam

#: them. The FE paper's afternoon subject is built on it -- a pseudocode
#: procedure with blanks A, B and C, and an answer group running a) to i) where
#: every option fixes all three at once. The learner cannot guess a blank
#: independently; they have to trace the algorithm.

#: count, so a longer group displays and grades correctly. Nine is the ceiling

#: There are two shapes of open-endedness here and they cannot be matched the

#:
#: is a one-word answer ("E-commerce") that shipped as an essay question,
#: because "describes" contains "describe". The learner then meets a textarea
#: where a text box belongs, and the recall sessions that reuse these questions
#: inherit the mistake.
#:
#: "Describe" only asks for prose when it is addressed *to the learner*, so it
#: is matched as a whole word in imperative position -- opening the stem, or
#: opening a clause inside it ("For the schema above, explain why the join
#: fails"). A verb in the middle of a noun phrase ("which term describes",

#: open-ended stem, and an answer like "Elicitation, analysis, specification,

#: learner will ever reproduce that exact string, in that exact order, with
#: that exact punctuation. An enumeration has many correct spellings and no
#: canonical one, which is precisely what exact matching cannot handle.
#:
#: Matched on the stem rather than the answer on purpose. The answer to a
