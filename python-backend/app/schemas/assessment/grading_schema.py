"""Wire and model schemas for grading one written answer.

Two families live here and they are deliberately not the same shape:

* the **wire** models mirror `com.capstone.rebyu.aigateway.dto`'s
  `AnswerGradingRequestDto` / `AnswerGradingResultDto` field for field,
  camelCase included -- Java is the only caller, and its records fail to bind
  anything else;
* the **verdict** models are what the grading agent is asked to produce, which
  is a *percentage* per answer rather than a point total. The model is not
  asked to do decimal arithmetic against `maxPoints`; that conversion happens
  in `app.services.ai.answer_grading` where it can be clamped and rounded
  deterministically.

Everything here is tolerant on input. A rejected tool call costs a whole
resample, so a model that writes `"85%"` or `85.0` where an int was wanted is
coerced rather than refused -- the bounds are enforced later, in code.
