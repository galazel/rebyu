    Exists because learner ids are not globally unique over time. The
    application database has been reset at least once while this schema was
    not: `learners` restarted from 1, and mastery rows survived for ids 6-12
    that no longer refer to anyone. A newly provisioned learner then inherited
    a dead learner's record -- a brand-new account opened on 98% mastery of a
    lesson it had never seen, with 89 answers behind it.

    So provisioning calls this before a learner ever answers anything. It is
    unconditional and idempotent: for a genuinely new id there is nothing to
    delete and it is a no-op, and for a reused id the only rows it can touch
    are by definition somebody else's.
