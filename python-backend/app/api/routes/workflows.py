    spending tokens the whole way, and its timeline stayed in the workspace

       deletes them itself.

    Step 2 was missing, and its absence was not cosmetic. `thread_id` is
    `str(generation_request_id)`, so an abandoned thread sits in `checkpoints`
    under an id a *later* request can be handed. Deleting the registry row
    while leaving the checkpoint behind is what produced runs whose progress
    view opened onto a previous certification's work: the row describing which
    run a thread belonged to was gone, and the thread was not.
