"""Live workflow timeline over a websocket.

The stream logic itself lives in `app.api.ws.stream` and is shared with the SSE
mount that the Java gateway relays to the browser; this module is only the
websocket transport for it.

Contract, in order:

1. `{"type": "snapshot", "run": {...}, "events": [...]}` -- the run's current
   state plus every event after the client's `last_seq`.
2. `{"type": "event", "event": {...}}` for each subsequent event.
3. `{"type": "heartbeat"}` periodically, so a client can distinguish "idle"
   from "connection dead".
4. `{"type": "complete", "status": "..."}` once nothing more can arrive.
