"""In-process fan-out of workflow events to connected websocket clients.

Deliberately paired with a DB replay in the socket handler rather than
trusted on its own. Two reasons:

1. A dropped or slow client must not lose history. `workflow_events` is the
   source of truth and carries a monotonic `seq`, so a client reconnects with
   its `last_seq` and receives exactly what it missed.
2. This broadcaster is process-local. With more than one uvicorn worker, an
   event published in worker A never reaches a socket held by worker B. The
   handler's periodic catch-up poll covers that case, so multi-worker
   degrades to slightly-delayed delivery instead of silence. Swapping this
   for Redis pub/sub is the fix if sub-second latency across workers is ever
   required.
