"""Creates the BKT training view at startup.

The view (`rebyu_bkt_training_data_v`) is what the training pipeline reads
learner responses through. It lives in `sql/create_training_view.sql`, and
until now nothing ever ran that file: it had to be applied by hand against
every database, and on any database where nobody had, training failed with

    relation "rebyu_bkt_training_data_v" does not exist

which is exactly how the 2026-08-29 training run died. A file that must be
remembered is a file that will be forgotten -- especially after a database is
dropped and recreated, when everything else comes back on its own.

Two properties make running this at startup safe:

*   It is `CREATE OR REPLACE`, so applying it on every boot is a no-op once the
    view matches, and an automatic repair when the definition has changed.
*   It reads tables owned by the Java backend (`assessment_attempts`,
    `assessment_attempt_questions`, `assessment_attempt_answers`, `questions`,
    `exams`, `exam_types`), which Hibernate
    creates with `ddl-auto: update`. On a freshly wiped database this service
    can easily start first, so a failure here is expected rather than
    exceptional: it is logged and swallowed, and the next restart -- or the
    next deploy -- creates the view once those tables exist.

Never raises. A missing analytics view must not stop the API from serving.
