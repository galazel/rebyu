        This service shares a database with the main Rebyu backend, so its

        collide with anything Java owns in `public`. `public` stays second so
        reads that cross into Java-owned tables and views still resolve.

        Issued as a statement after connecting rather than as a libpq startup
        parameter (`-csearch_path=...`). Connection poolers -- Neon's pooled
        endpoint, PgBouncer, RDS Proxy -- reject unknown startup options
        outright:

            ERROR: unsupported startup parameter in options: search_path

        which made every query fail against a pooled URL. Since the pooled host
        is usually the one in a deployment's connection string, that took the
        whole service down: no BKT writes, and no generation runs for the
        workspace to show. A post-connect SET works on both.
