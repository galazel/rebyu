"""Whether a run stops for a human, or generates straight through.

The graph was built HITL-first: every phase parks at an `interrupt` and waits
for an admin. That is the right default for a curriculum someone intends to
edit as it is written, and the wrong one for the far more common case of
"build this and tell me when it's done" -- there the pauses are the whole
cost, because a run left parked overnight is a run that generated nothing
overnight.

So the mode is per-run and chosen by whoever starts it:

* ``GUIDED`` -- pause at every review, as before. Still the default when
  nothing says otherwise, so an existing caller keeps its behaviour.
* ``AUTO`` -- never interrupt. Every review node approves and moves on.

It is deliberately one flag read by every review site rather than a
pre-seeded `auto_approve_scopes` list: the per-scope list only covers the
three per-item phases, so a run seeded that way would still have stopped four
more times (curriculum, mock, diagnostic, question bank). Those are exactly
the pauses that stranded runs.

A GUIDED run can be switched to AUTO mid-flight -- see
`certification_run.set_review_mode`, behind the workspace's "finish without
me" action. The reverse is not offered: a run already generating unattended
has nothing to hand back to.
