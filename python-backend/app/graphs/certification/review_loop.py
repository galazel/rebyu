"""Per-item review loop shared by the major, middle, and lesson phases.

The certification graph used to fan every item out in parallel and take a
single review covering all of them, so an admin could not approve category 1
and reject category 2. This replaces that with a cursor-driven sequential
walk: one item is generated, validated, and reviewed before the next starts.

The three phases differ only in what they iterate over and what they
generate, so the loop is defined once here and parameterised, rather than
copy-pasted three times with three chances to diverge.

Review actions: Approve, Edit, Improve with AI, Regenerate, Reject,
Approve Remaining. Every version of every artifact is retained.
