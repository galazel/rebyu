        FOR EACH major:
            FOR EACH middle under it:
                FOR EACH lesson under it: content -> quiz -> validate -> [review]
                middle quiz (from those lessons) -> validate -> [review]
            major quiz (from every lesson under it) -> validate -> [review]
        mock -> [review] -> diagnostic -> [review] -> bank -> audit -> [review] -> END

    Bottom-up and interleaved, because every assessment is generated *from the
    content it tests*. The previous shape ran three flat passes -- all majors,
    then all middles, then all lessons -- so each category quiz was written
    before a single lesson existed and had nothing to draw on but the
    category's one-line description; the exams likewise sampled the outline
    rather than the teaching. The nesting is produced by `LESSON_PHASE`'s
    `in_scope` boundary test and the two advance routers, not by nested
    subgraphs -- see `nodes.route_after_middle_advance`.

    Categories generate only a quiz: per Q2 they are organizational, and all
    instructional content belongs to lessons.

    Previously each phase fanned out with Send() and took a *single* review
    covering every item, so an admin could not approve one category and
    reject another. The loops below walk one item at a time; "Approve
    Remaining" (see review_loop) lets a reviewer drain the rest of a phase
    once they have seen enough.

    Kept synchronous and dependency-injected: it does no I/O itself, so tests
    can compile against an InMemorySaver with no database.
