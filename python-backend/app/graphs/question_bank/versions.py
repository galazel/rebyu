"""Batch version history for the question-bank graph.

Mirrors the certification graph: the batch itself goes to `workflow_events`,
and only a lightweight reference stays in graph state. Holding each version's
full question list in state meant every improve/regenerate cycle grew a blob
that LangGraph re-serialized into every subsequent checkpoint.
