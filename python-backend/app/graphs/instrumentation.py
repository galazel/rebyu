"""Node-level progress events.

The registry schema has carried `node.started` / `node.completed` with durations
and retry counts since step 14, but nothing emitted them: the only events on a
run were the coarse workflow/review transitions. That was enough for a "which
runs are waiting for me" list and not enough for a live timeline -- a twenty-
lesson certification would sit on `workflow.started` for many minutes with
nothing to show, which is exactly the loading-spinner experience the workspace
exists to replace.

`instrument` wraps a node so the timeline gets a task entry with real timing.

Two deliberate limits:

*Not every node.* Gate and advance nodes are bookkeeping no-ops, and review
nodes already emit `review.waiting`. Wrapping those would triple the event
volume and bury the events a human actually reads.

*Never fails the node.* Emitting is best-effort in both directions: a registry
write failure must not fail generation that otherwise succeeded, and a node's
own exception is recorded and re-raised unchanged rather than being swallowed.
