"""Rate-limit classification and per-model quota state.

A 429 is several different failures wearing one status code, and they need
opposite remedies:

* **Burst limits** (per-minute) clear in seconds. Backing off and retrying the
  same model is correct, and `app.ai.retry` already does exactly that.
* **Daily limits** clear hours later::

      Rate limit reached for model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` ... on tokens
      per day (TPD): Limit 100000, Used 96604, Requested 9985.
      Please try again in 1h34m52.896s

  The retry policy's ceiling is 60s across 5 attempts, so *every* attempt
  against a spent daily budget is guaranteed to fail. Retrying only converts
  an immediate failure into a failure three minutes later; the generation run
  is lost either way.

The remedy for the second case is a different model, not a longer sleep, and
budgets are scoped per model -- note the error names one. So this module
supplies two things: telling the cases apart, and remembering which models are
spent, so later calls in the same run skip them instead of rediscovering the
wall one by one.

Routing through OpenRouter adds two failures a single-vendor client never sees,
and both are classified here because both change what the caller should do:

* **402 / "insufficient credits"** is account-level. No model in any chain will
  work, so it must *not* trigger a fallback walk (`is_out_of_credits`).
* **502 / "Provider returned error"** means OpenRouter is fine and the vendor
  behind that one slug is not. Neither a rate limit nor a bug here; the remedy
  is a model from a different vendor (`is_upstream_unavailable`).

Error *text* is matched defensively rather than exactly. OpenRouter forwards
each upstream vendor's own message, so the wording varies by which company's
model was being called, and pinning exact strings would silently stop matching.
Status codes are the primary signal; text only narrows.

State is per-process and in-memory: it is a cache, not a ledger. A restart
re-discovers exhaustion on the next call, which costs one wasted request.
