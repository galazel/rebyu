"""Model fallback for a task whose model cannot serve it right now.

`app.ai.retry` covers failures that clear on their own. This covers the ones
that do not clear inside any backoff worth waiting through: a model whose daily
budget is gone for hours, and an upstream provider that OpenRouter cannot reach
at all. Instead of failing a curriculum or question run outright, the call walks
that task's configured chain of models and reissues against the next one.

Why this takes a *factory* rather than a built agent: `create_agent()` bakes the
model into the agent at construction, so switching models means rebuilding.
The agent factories are `lru_cache`d per model name, so rebuilding costs one
dictionary lookup after the first time.

Note what is deliberately *not* a fallback: running out of OpenRouter credits.
That is an account-level failure, so every model in the chain would fail the
same way -- see `no_credit_remaining` below.
