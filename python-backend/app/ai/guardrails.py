"""Screening of model output before it is allowed into a run.

Everything an agent produces here ends up in front of a learner, so three
classes of failure have to be caught before an admin ever sees them:

* **sensitive data** -- a key, a card number, someone's email that the model
  lifted out of an uploaded document and pasted into a lesson;
* **prompt-injection and meta-leakage** -- the model repeating instructions
  from a source document, or narrating its own system prompt;
* **irrelevance** -- content that is fluent, safe, and about the wrong
  subject.

A violation raises `GuardrailViolation`, which is a `ValueError` on purpose:
`app.ai.retry` already classifies ValueError as malformed output and resamples
it. Blocking is therefore the same mechanism the codebase already uses for a
bad sample, not a second parallel error path -- the run continues, the offending
text never reaches a reviewer, and the next sample usually differs.

Hybrid by design. The deterministic scanners below are the floor: they are
fast, need no model, and cannot be talked out of a match. `guardrails-ai` is
consulted on top when it is installed (see `_external_validators`), because
toxicity and PII classifiers catch what patterns cannot. Its absence degrades
the screen, it never breaks it -- an optional dependency must not be able to
take generation down.
