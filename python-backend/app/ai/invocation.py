"""Shared agent invocation.

`_invoke_question_agent` was previously duplicated verbatim in
`app/graphs/certification/nodes.py` and `app/graphs/question_bank/nodes.py`,
as was the retry decorator above it. Both graphs generate questions
identically -- only scope, context, and instructions differ -- so the call
belongs in one place.

Both helpers take an agent *factory* rather than a built agent. `create_agent()`
bakes the model in at construction, so recovering from an exhausted daily token
budget by switching models means rebuilding -- see `app.ai.router`. Retry and
model fallback both live there, which is why neither function below carries a
retry decorator of its own.
