"""Consumer for question.generation.queue.

Mirrors certification_generation.py: fetch by id, re-run the same HITL
question-bank LangGraph the direct-upload `/question-bank/generate` HTTP
route uses (app/api/routes/question_bank.py), and persist the result once it
resolves without pausing. Since the graph pauses for review after every
batch (see QuestionBankState's await_batch_review loop), most runs will stay
at PROCESSING pending a reviewer -- there was never an existing live table
for question drafts to land in either way (they were ephemeral, returned
straight to the HTTP caller before), so a fresh run only ever writes
generated_question_drafts once fully approved end to end.
