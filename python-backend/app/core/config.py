    # Per-task AI models
    # One model per task, not one model per "tier". These jobs differ by more

    #
    #   lesson          a whole lesson, 18+ authored content blocks, research
    #                   tool calls, structured output -- the single hardest and
    #                   most quality-sensitive thing this service does
    #   curriculum      one large JSON syllabus, planned in one shot
    #   question        many small batches, run dozens of times per generation
    #                   -- the volume task, so unit price dominates
    #   tutor           interactive; latency matters more than depth
    #   lesson_audit    reads a long lesson, returns a verdict
    #   document_audit  reads a few document samples, returns a boolean
    #
    # Pointing all six at one model means either wasting the biggest model on a
    # boolean or underpowering the lessons. Each therefore gets its own model,
    # fallback chain, completion budget and temperature, resolved in
    # `app.ai.tasks`.
    #
    # EVERYTHING RUNS ON OPENROUTER, ON `:free` SLUGS -- no credit is spent.
    # One provider for all six tasks, which keeps the table simple. Know the
    # limits before relying on it:
    #
    #   * The free allowance is ~50 requests per DAY for the whole ACCOUNT --
    #     shared across every `:free` model, so a fallback chain cannot route
    #     around it. A full certification needs roughly 100+ calls (18 lessons
    #     x2 round trips, ~30 question batches, 18 audits), so A COMPLETE RUN
    #     DOES NOT FIT. Expect it to stop partway with a 429 naming
    #     `free-models-per-day`. One or two lessons to check the pipeline is fine.
    #     A one-off $10 purchase raises the cap to ~1000/day permanently.
    #   * Models are chosen for MULTI-TURN tool support and output ceiling first.
    #     `lesson` and `curriculum` call a Serper web search and then answer, and
    #     most free slugs cannot do that round trip -- see the note on those two.
    #   * Quality is lower than paid. Measured: a free lesson used 8 distinct
    #     block types (the best of any free model tested); Groq's llama-3.3-70b
    #     managed only 5. `.env.example` carries a ready paid block.
    #
    # `ai_default_model` is the backstop appended to every chain. Empty here on
    # purpose: every task already names a same-provider fallback, and a global
    # default would be the one entry able to smuggle a paid slug into a chain

    #: reintroduce that timeout, so the two settings move together -- which is
    #: why a test pins the relationship rather than trusting these comments.
