"""Retrieval: fetch wide, rerank, assemble a bounded context.

Previously retrieval was a single `k=5` similarity call over 300-character
chunks -- roughly 1,500 characters of context to author an entire
certification curriculum, which is a large part of why generated curricula
were thin. Here a wider candidate set (`fetch_k`) is narrowed by an optional
cross-encoder reranker to `top_k`, then assembled under a character budget.

The reranker is optional and degrades gracefully: if the model can't be
loaded, retrieval still returns similarity-ordered results rather than
failing the whole generation run.

    `retrieve` ranks the whole corpus by similarity and takes the best
    `top_k`, which is right when the question has an answer somewhere and
    wrong when the question is "what does this corpus cover". Ranking is
    winner-take-all across files: one long, densely-worded document can hold
    every one of the 24 slots, and the planner then designs a curriculum for
    the only material it was shown.

    That is not hypothetical. TOPCIT was uploaded as six documents, one per
    domain -- Software, Database, System Architecture, Information Security,
    IT Business and Ethics, Project Management -- and the planner produced
    three major categories, having never seen the other three files. The
    documents were indexed and healthy; they simply lost the ranking.

    So this keeps the ranking but spends it round-robin: the best unused chunk
    from file A, then from file B, and so on, wrapping until `top_k` is full.
    Every file that put anything in the candidate pool is represented before
    any file gets a second chunk, and a file with more relevant material still
    ends up with more slots once every file has one.
