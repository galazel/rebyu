"""Per-certification vector storage, backed by Qdrant.

Each certification gets its own Qdrant *collection*, which is what makes
cross-certification bleed structurally impossible: a retrieval is scoped by
the collection it queries, so no metadata filter can be forgotten. That
property is inherited from the FAISS implementation this replaced, and the
reason it existed there is worth keeping in view -- the original code rebuilt
one global index on every ingestion, so ingesting certification B erased
certification A.

Why Qdrant over the previous local FAISS files:

* FAISS indexes lived on the API process's own disk, so they could not be
  shared between processes and vanished with the container. Qdrant is a
  service, so ingestion and retrieval can run anywhere.
* `FAISS.load_local` required `allow_dangerous_deserialization=True` -- it
  unpickles. That was tolerable only because this service was the sole
  writer.
* Appending meant load-whole-index, mutate, rewrite-whole-index. Qdrant
  upserts.

The public surface is deliberately unchanged (`namespace_for`,
`index_exists`, `add_documents`, `delete_index`, `load_index`) so callers --
the certification graph, the question-bank graph, and run recovery -- did not
have to change.
