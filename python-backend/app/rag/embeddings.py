"""Embedding model access.

Replaces `HashEmbeddings`, which hashed tokens into 256 buckets with
SHA-256 and counted them. That is a hashing bag-of-words vectorizer: it has
no semantic capability (`"authentication"` and `"login"` shared no signal),
and at 256 dimensions collisions were frequent enough to inject false
positives. Every "grounded generation" claim in the system rested on it.

The model is resolved lazily and cached, so importing this module never
downloads weights or loads native libraries -- that matters because the
graph modules import transitively from here at collection time in tests.
