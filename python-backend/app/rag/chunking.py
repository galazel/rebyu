"""Semantic-boundary chunking.

The previous implementation sliced text into fixed 300-character windows
regardless of word or sentence boundaries:

    for start in range(0, len(text), chunk_size - overlap):
        chunks.append(text[start:start + chunk_size])

That routinely cut mid-word, and 300 chars (~75 tokens) is far too small to
carry a coherent concept -- retrieving k=5 of them gave a generation agent
~1500 characters of context to author an entire certification curriculum.

RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter instead prefers paragraph breaks, then line
breaks, then sentence enders, then words, only falling back to a hard cut
when a single token exceeds the window.
