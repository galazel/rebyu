"""Bring the TOPCIT mock exam up to the certification's own exam structure.

`certifications.exam_structure` is what the planner researched about the real
paper, and it is the authority on what a mock exam should look like:

    total_items 65, duration 150 minutes, and a coverage split of
    Software Development 20%, Database 15%, Network 15%, Security 15%,
    Technical Communications 15%, IT Business 10%, Project Management 10%.

The exam that was generated has 50 items in 90 minutes, because it was built
before the planner wrote that structure and fell back to the configured
`mock_exam_questions` default. Its coverage is off in the same way: Software
Development carries 6 items where the weights ask for 13.

This adds the 15 missing items and corrects the duration and declared total.
It ADDS rather than rebalances: the exam is PUBLISHED and learners have sat it,
so deleting items would invalidate attempts already recorded against them. The
additions are placed where the shortfall is worst, which lands every major
either on its target or within two items of it.

The questions are written by hand, not generated -- same standard as the
diagram briefs: a scenario a practitioner would recognise, distractors that are
wrong for a stateable reason rather than obviously silly, and an explanation
that says why the right answer is right.
