"""Restores SHORT_ANSWER to questions a substring bug typed as DESCRIPTIVE.

`QuestionDraft._reclassify_open_ended_short_answers` turns an open-ended
SHORT_ANSWER into a DESCRIPTIVE, because SHORT_ANSWER is graded by exact string
match and an essay question can never be matched. That repair is right. The
list it matched on was not: verbs like "describe" and "explain" sat in it as
bare substrings, so any stem merely *containing* one was reclassified --

    "Which term describes the process of conducting business transactions
     over computer networks, such as the internet?"        -> E-commerce

is a one-term answer that shipped as an essay question, and the learner meets a
textarea where a text box belongs. Recall sessions, which reassemble existing
questions rather than authoring new ones, inherit it.

The schema now matches those verbs as whole words in imperative position. This
fixes the rows written before that.

A row is repaired only when all of these hold, so a question the model
deliberately wrote as DESCRIPTIVE is never touched:

  * it is DESCRIPTIVE with an AI_SEMANTIC text config;
  * the stem contains a directive verb as a bare substring -- i.e. the old rule
    fired on it, which is what makes this row *this bug's* doing;
  * the fixed rule does not fire: no open-ended phrase, no directive in
    imperative position, no enumeration, no counted set;
  * the stored answer is within SHORT_ANSWER_MAX_WORDS, so exact matching is
    actually possible against it.

The tests are imported from the schema module rather than restated, so this can
never drift from what generation now does.
