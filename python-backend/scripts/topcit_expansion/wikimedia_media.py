"""Finding lesson images on Wikimedia, and proving they load before using them.

Serper is out of credits, but the deeper problem is that Serper was never the
right source for this. Its top hit is whatever ranks, on whatever host, under
whatever licence -- which is how every image in the hand-written lessons ended
up on a domain that 403s hotlinks, with no licence anyone had checked.

Wikimedia fixes all three at once: it permits hotlinking, its URLs are stable,
and everything on it carries an open licence. The cost is that a bare Commons
search is easily fooled by ambiguous acronyms -- "STRIDE" returns a British MP,
"SIEM" returns butterflies photographed in Siem Reap. So the lookup is anchored
two ways:

  1. Resolve the topic to an English Wikipedia article, and prefer images that
     article actually uses. An article is a human-curated statement that these
     pictures illustrate this subject.
  2. Fall back to a Commons file search, but only accept a file whose *name*
     overlaps the query. An unscored Commons hit is how you get the butterfly.

Either way the URL is then fetched with browser headers and kept only if real
image bytes come back.
