"""Understanding of IT Business -> IT Business Fundamentals (MID 126).

Completes the category at five lessons: how IT capability is acquired, and who
does the work. Rebuilt to the format the system's own lessons use -- roughly
4,900 words over 28-40 sections, about 46 blocks, diagrams where a picture does
the explaining, and no coloured card grids.

Scoped deliberately away from Project Management's "Technical Proposal
Evaluation" (403) and "Partnership and Subcontract Management" (404), which
cover evaluating a bid and running a subcontract. These lessons cover the
decision made before either.

Written against TOPCIT ESSENCE Business Field (Ver.2), section "Understanding
of IT Business Adoption".
