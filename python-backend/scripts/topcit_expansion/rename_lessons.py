"""Renames lessons whose titles collide with another lesson's.

The audit found "Software Testing and Quality Assurance" (Software
Implementation and Testing) and "Quality Assurance and Testing" (Project
Quality and Support) 75% alike by name while sharing none of their subject
matter. That is the worst combination: a learner searching the catalogue
cannot tell them apart, and the one they pick may be from the wrong major
entirely.

The Software Development one keeps its name, because "Software Testing and
Quality Assurance" describes its content precisely. The Project Management one
is renamed to say what it actually covers -- quality management as a project
discipline, not software test technique.

The lesson's own quiz is renamed with it. A quiz titled after the old lesson
name is the same navigation problem one level down.
