"""Builders for a lesson's `lesson_component_structure` and its quiz items.

The column is a JSON array of sections, each `{sectionName, content}`, and
`content` is a list of typed blocks the lesson renderer understands
(frontend/src/components/certifications/lesson-content-renderer.jsx). The block
shapes are fiddly and easy to get subtly wrong -- an accordion whose body sits
under `description` instead of `content` renders as a stack of titles with
nothing beneath them -- so nothing in a content module writes them by hand.

Ids are uuid4 because that is what the existing lessons carry; the renderer
only uses them as React keys, but staying consistent means a hand-written
lesson and a generated one are indistinguishable in the database.
