"""Makes every scoped exam draw from every lesson inside its scope.

Nine lessons were added to Understanding of Network and none of their questions
reached the middle or major exams, so a learner sitting "Understanding of
Network Exam" was tested on 5 of the major's 14 lessons. The diagnostic and
mock exams have the same gap at certification scale: 25 of 51 lessons and 32 of
51 respectively.

The repair is a swap, not an append. Each exam has a designed length -- 20
items for a middle exam, 30 for a major, 40 for the diagnostic, 65 for the mock
-- and lengthening them changes the assessment. So a slot for an unrepresented
lesson is taken from a lesson that currently contributes more than one item,
and never from one contributing its only item.

Two constraints make the swap safe rather than arbitrary:

  * The donor is always chosen from the SAME major category as the lesson being
    added. The mock exam's item split across majors was researched against the
    real paper -- Software Development 20%, Database 15%, Network 15%,
    Security 15%, Technical Communications 15%, IT Business 10%, Project
    Management 10% -- and swapping across majors would quietly destroy it.

  * An exam is only lengthened when it is shorter than the number of lessons it
    must cover, which is true of the diagnostic alone: 40 items cannot cover 51
    lessons. It grows to exactly one item per lesson, and its duration grows in
    proportion.

Safe to run because no learner has attempted any of these exams -- verified at
run time, and the script refuses to touch an exam that has attempts.

Dry run by default; --apply writes.
