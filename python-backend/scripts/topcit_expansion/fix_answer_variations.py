"""Repairs short-answer grading across the TOPCIT bank.

Two separate defects, both of which mark correct answers wrong:

  1. 106 EXACT_MATCH questions carry no accepted variations at all, so the
     learner must reproduce the stored string. A question whose answer is
     "Logical Link Control (LLC)" rejects "LLC".

  2. Every one of the 20 questions that DOES have variations stored them
     comma-joined. AssessmentAttemptService.matchesTextAnswer splits on a
     newline, so the whole list is compared as one long string and none of
     the variations has ever matched anything.

The matcher trims and lowercases before comparing, so nothing here needs case
or whitespace variants -- only genuinely different forms: acronym against
expansion, with and without an article, singular against plural, and the
alternate names a learner would reasonably write.

Dry run by default; --apply writes.
