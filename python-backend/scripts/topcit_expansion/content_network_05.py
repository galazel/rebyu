"""Understanding of Network -> Emerging Network Technologies (MID 122).

Rebuilt to the format the system's own lessons use: roughly 4,900 words over
28-40 sections, about 46 blocks, diagrams where a picture does the explaining,
most sections carrying more than one block, and no coloured card grids.

Topics were chosen against what is already in this major category so that
nothing overlaps: lesson 380 covers telecoms service architecture, SIP, RTP and
IMS, and lessons 381 and 382 cover M2M and IoT. None of them touches SDN, NFV
or overlay networking.
