"""Understanding of Security -> MID 124 and MID 125.

Rebuilt to the format the system's own lessons use: roughly 4,900 words over
28-40 sections, about 46 blocks, diagrams where a picture does the explaining,
and no coloured card grids.

  * Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery finishes Risk Management and
    Assessment. It is the risk response the other lessons do not cover: what
    you do when prevention has already failed.

  * Security Policies, Standards and Procedures joins Information Security
    Management Systems. The existing three lessons cover ISMS frameworks,
    implementation and monitoring, but not the document hierarchy an ISMS is
    actually made of.
