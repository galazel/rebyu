"""Understanding of Security -> Risk Management and Assessment (MID 124).

Rebuilt to the format the system's own lessons use: roughly 4,900 words over
28-40 sections, about 46 blocks, diagrams where a picture does the explaining,
and no coloured card grids.

The category already held "Risk Assessment Methodologies" and "Security Risk
Analysis", both about measuring risk once you know what the risks are. These
two cover the work either side of that: identifying threats in the first place,
and finding the weaknesses they would exploit. Neither lesson re-derives ALE,
SLE or ARO, which lesson 385 already teaches.

Written against TOPCIT ESSENCE Understanding of Security (Technical Field
03-2, Ver.2), section "Types of Network Attacks and Defense Mechanisms".
