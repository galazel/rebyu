"""Understanding of Security -> Information Security Fundamentals (MID 123).

Completes the category at five lessons. content_security_01 supplied
cryptography and hashing; these two supply what is built on top of them --
proving who someone is, and deciding what they may then do.

Rebuilt to the format the system's own lessons use: roughly 4,900 words over
28-40 sections, about 46 blocks, diagrams where a picture does the explaining,
and no coloured card grids.

Written against TOPCIT ESSENCE Understanding of Security (Technical Field
03-2, Ver.2), sections "03 Authentication Technologies" and "01 Access
Control".
