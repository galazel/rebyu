"""Batch 1: five diagram questions rewritten as full briefs, with model answers.

Each brief follows the pattern of a real examination item: a named scenario,
lettered requirements that state multiplicity and lifetime dependency IN WORDS
so the learner must choose between composition and aggregation rather than
guess, then numbered tasks ending in the judgements they have to defend.

The reference answers every lettered requirement, carries multiplicity at both
ends of every relationship, and uses the notation the type calls for.

"Northwind Logistics" Inventory Accuracy Study

Northwind Logistics runs several warehouses and cannot trust its stock figures: \
counts are done on paper, entered days later, and disagree with what the system \
says is on the shelf. Before any technical solution is proposed, the problem \
domain must be modelled as it exists today.

a) Each warehouse has an ID, name, address and capacity in cubic metres. A \
warehouse is divided into one or more storage zones; a zone has no meaning \
apart from the warehouse it sits in, and closing a warehouse closes its zones \
with it.
b) Every inventory item has a SKU, description, unit of measure and reorder \
level. The same item may be stocked in many zones, and a zone stocks many \
items; the quantity on hand is a property of that pairing, not of either side.
c) An inventory count is carried out at one warehouse on one date by exactly \
one member of staff, and has a status. A member of staff may carry out any \
number of counts.
d) A count consists of one or more count lines, each naming an item, the \
quantity counted and the quantity the system expected. A count line cannot \
exist outside its count.
e) A count line raises at most one discrepancy, recording the variance and the \
date it was resolved. An item appears in many count lines over time."""
