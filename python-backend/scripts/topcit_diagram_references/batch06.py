Fairmont builds assemblies from sub-assemblies, which are themselves built from \

a) A part has a part number, name, unit of measure and a flag saying whether it \

component -- is a part. There is no separate assembly entity.
b) A BOM line says that one part is used inside another, with a quantity per \
unit and the dates the line is valid from and to. A part may be the parent in \
many lines and the child in many others.
c) A part is revised as one or more part revisions, each with a revision code, \
release date and status. A revision has no meaning apart from its part.
d) A supplier offers parts under sourcing agreements, each with a unit cost and \
a lead time. A supplier offers many parts and a part may be offered by many \
suppliers.
e) A plant holds stock of any number of parts, recording the quantity on hand \
and a safety stock level. A stock row cannot exist without its plant.
f) A works order builds a quantity of one part at one plant by a due date.
g) A works order consumes any number of material issues, each recording the \

Corvus loads its warehouse overnight. When the load half-completes, nobody can \
tell what state the warehouse is in. Model the interaction so the ordering and \
the failure path are explicit.

a) The load scheduler starts the run, passing the run date to the extractor, \
and waits for it to finish.
b) For each source table in turn, the extractor reads the rows changed since \
the last run from the source database, waits for the batch, and writes it to the \
staging area. This repeats until every source table is done.
c) The extractor then reports the total row count back to the scheduler.
d) The scheduler calls the transformer, which reads the staged rows and applies \
the business rules to itself before deciding anything.
e) If validation passes, the transformer loads the dimensions first and then \
the facts, waiting for the warehouse to confirm the rows loaded, and finally \
truncates the staging area.
f) If validation fails, nothing is loaded, staging is NOT truncated, and the \
transformer raises a load failure to the operations alert service. It does not \
wait for that alert to be delivered.
g) In both cases the transformer returns the outcome to the scheduler."""

a) Every device has a device ID, firmware version, last-seen timestamp and \
battery percentage, and can report whether it is online and describe itself.
b) There are three kinds of device and nothing is ever just a device. A sensor \
adds a unit and a sample period; an actuator adds a current state and a safe \
state; a gateway adds an uplink type and a queue depth.
c) A sensor produces any number of readings. A reading has a timestamp, a value \
and a quality flag. Readings are meaningless without the sensor that took them \
and are purged with it.
d) An actuator executes any number of commands. A command has an ID, an issue \
time and a payload. Commands are issued centrally and are retained for audit \
after the actuator is replaced.
e) A site has an ID, name and grid reference and hosts one or more devices. \
Devices are moved between sites, so they are not destroyed when a site closes.
f) A gateway relays for one or more devices. Those devices exist whether or not \
the gateway does.
g) A gateway speaks one or more protocols. A protocol has a name and a port \

Sentinel's risk register is a spreadsheet in which the same risk appears three \

a) An asset has a name, a type and a business value, and is owned by exactly \
one asset owner. Owners have a name and a department and remain on file after an \
asset is disposed of.
b) An asset exposes any number of vulnerabilities, each with a reference, a \
description and a severity. A vulnerability has no meaning apart from its asset.
c) A threat has a name, a source and a description. Threats are held in a \
central catalogue and outlive any particular risk.
d) A risk arises where a threat can exploit a vulnerability. A risk records the \
date identified and a status, and belongs to exactly one vulnerability and one \
threat.
e) A risk is scored as one or more risk scores, each with a likelihood, an \
impact, the date scored and a current-row flag. Scores are never overwritten -- \
a rescore inserts a new row.
f) A control has a reference, a name and a type, and is held in a central \
catalogue.
g) A risk is mitigated by any number of control applications. Each records the \
control applied, the date and an effectiveness rating. A control may be applied \
to many risks.
h) A risk receives one or more treatment decisions, each accepted by exactly \
one asset owner and recording the strategy and the rationale.

ISMS Monitoring and Continual Improvement

An information security manager is documenting the check-and-act half of the \
management system cycle.

a) The manager plans the monitoring programme for the period.
b) Three monitoring activities then run: collecting control performance \
metrics, conducting the internal audit, and reviewing security incidents. They \
are independent and may run in any order or at the same time; analysis waits \
until all three are complete.
c) The results are analysed against the security objectives.
d) If a nonconformity is found, a root cause analysis is performed, a \
corrective action is raised, and the action is implemented.
e) The corrective action's effectiveness is then checked. If it was not \
effective, the root cause analysis is done again -- raising a second action \
without re-analysing the cause is not permitted.
f) Whether or not there was a nonconformity, a management review is held.
g) The review asks whether the ISMS is still suitable. If it is not, the \
objectives or the scope are changed.
h) In both cases the monitoring programme is updated for the next period, and \
the cycle ends."""
