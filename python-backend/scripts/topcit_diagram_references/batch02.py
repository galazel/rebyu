"Helios" Expense Management - Claim Approval Process

Helios is automating the approval of employee expense claims. The process must \
be modelled before it is built.

a) An employee submits a claim. The system validates it against the receipt \
rules and the policy limits.
b) If any receipt is missing or unreadable the claim is returned to the \
employee, who may correct and resubmit it. A claim may go round this loop any \
number of times.
c) A claim of 500 or less needs the line manager's approval only.
d) A claim over 500 needs the line manager's AND the finance officer's \
approval. Those two reviews are independent: they may happen in either order or \
at the same time, and the claim proceeds only once both are in.
e) If every required approval is given the reimbursement is scheduled. If any \
approver rejects it, no reimbursement is scheduled.
f) In both cases the employee is notified of the outcome, and the process then \
ends."""

A quality manager is documenting where verification happens across the \

b) Once baselined, a design is produced and put through a design walkthrough, \
which is also static.
c) Code is implemented, then exercised dynamically: unit testing, then \
integration testing, then system testing, in that order.
d) After system testing the exit criteria are checked. If they are not met, \
defects are logged and fixed, and the process returns to implementation -- not \
to design.
e) When the exit criteria are met, acceptance testing is carried out with the \
customer.
f) If the customer does not accept, the defects are logged and fixed on the same \

"Ledgerline" Accounting System - Responding to a Platform Upgrade

Ledgerline's accounting software must keep running as the database and \
operating system beneath it are upgraded. The maintenance team wants the \
decision process written down, so that every change is classified before it is \
scheduled.

a) When a vendor announces a platform upgrade, the team assesses its impact on \
the accounting system. If the system is not affected, the change is recorded, \
monitored, and the process ends.
b) If it is affected, the change is classified. A change that repairs a defect \
in the delivered system is corrective maintenance.
c) A change driven by the environment moving underneath the system -- a new \
database version, a changed OS API -- while its own requirements are unchanged, \
is adaptive maintenance.
d) A change that answers a new or refined user requirement is perfective \
maintenance.
e) A change that is none of those -- refactoring, raising test coverage, \
addressing technical debt, with no visible change for users -- is preventive \
maintenance.
f) Whichever it is, the change is then planned and scheduled, implemented, and \
regression tested. If regression fails, the regression is repaired and \
retested. Once it passes, the change is released and the process ends."""
