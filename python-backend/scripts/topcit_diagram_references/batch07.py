a) The author identifies the need and the audience, then selects the document \
type and its template.
b) The author writes the draft, which goes to a subject expert for technical \
review.
c) If it is not technically correct, the content is corrected and reviewed \
again. This may happen any number of times.
d) Once technically correct, the document goes to editorial review for clarity \
and style.
e) If it is not editorially acceptable, the wording is revised and it is \
edited again -- it does NOT return to technical review for a wording change.
f) Controlled documents require an approval signature; uncontrolled ones do \
not.
g) If approval is refused, the document returns to content correction, not to \
editorial review.
h) The document is published with a version number and distributed to its \
audience.

Fenland cannot currently say which firmware a device was running when a reading \

a) A site has a name, grid reference and a remote flag, and hosts any number of \
devices. Devices are relocated between sites, so they are not destroyed with a \
site.
b) A device has a serial number and a commissioning date, and is specified by \
exactly one device model. Models have a manufacturer, model name and protocol, \
and are a catalogue that outlives any device.
c) A model is released as any number of firmware versions, each with a version \
number and a release date. A firmware version has no meaning apart from its \
model.
d) A device receives any number of firmware installs. Each names one firmware \
version and records the install date and the outcome. Installs are deleted with \
the device.
e) A device exposes one or more channels, each with a name, a unit and a valid \
range. A channel cannot exist without its device.
f) A channel records any number of readings, each with a timestamp, a value and \
a quality flag.
g) A channel is watched by any number of alarm rules, each with a comparison, a \
threshold and a severity.
h) A reading triggers any number of alarms. Each alarm is raised by exactly one \
rule and records when it was raised and when it was acknowledged, which is empty \
until someone acknowledges it.
i) A device is sent any number of commands, each issued by exactly one operator \
with a timestamp, a payload and a state. Operators remain on file after their \
commands complete."""

provides IFilteredTraffic. Nothing bypasses it.
b) The edge firewall passes traffic to the intrusion prevention system for \
inspection.
c) The IPS provides IInspectedTraffic to the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy \
is the only component that terminates a client connection.
d) The reverse proxy reaches the application tier through IApplicationService. \
An internet client never reaches the application tier directly.
e) The application tier reaches the database tier only by traversing the \
internal firewall, which provides IDataAccess. The application tier does not \
connect to the database directly.
f) Administrators reach internal systems only through the admin bastion, which \
requires strong authentication from the MFA service through IStrongAuth.
g) The bastion also traverses the internal firewall; it is not exempt from it.
h) Every control component -- the edge firewall, the IPS, the reverse proxy, \

1. Draw the activity diagram with exactly one initial node and one final node -- \
requirement (a) also terminates, so route it to the same final node.
2. Show every action in requirements (a) to (i) as an activity, and mark which \
of the five DMAIC phases each belongs to.
3. Model requirement (b) with a fork and a join, and explain in one sentence \
why the measurement system must be assessed before any conclusion is drawn from \
the baseline.
4. Label EVERY decision branch with its guard, and show all three loops \
returning to the correct activity.
5. Requirement (h) loops back to monitoring rather than to the improvement \
design. Explain in one sentence why, and state what the opening paragraph's \
"straight to a solution" approach skips."""
