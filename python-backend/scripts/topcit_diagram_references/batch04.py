Data Link Layer - Frame Handling Class Model

You are modelling the classes a switch and its interfaces need in order to move \
frames across a link.

a) Every frame carries a frame ID, a source and destination MAC address, a \
payload and a frame check sequence, and can compute its FCS and report whether \
it is corrupt.
b) There are three kinds of frame and nothing is ever just a frame. A data \
frame adds a sequence number and payload length; an acknowledgement frame adds \
the sequence number it acknowledges; a control frame adds a control type.
c) A MAC address is six octets and can report whether it is the broadcast \
address and what its OUI is. A frame addresses exactly two MAC addresses -- \
source and destination.
d) A network interface has an ID, a hardware address, an MTU and a link state, \
and transmits any number of frames. Frames are destroyed once transmitted; \
interfaces are not.
e) An interface runs exactly one link protocol. A protocol has a window size \
and a timeout, and can transmit a frame and react to a timeout. A protocol is \
configured on the interface but exists in the protocol stack independently of \
it.
f) Stop-and-wait and go-back-N are both link protocols; a bare protocol is \
never used on its own. Stop-and-wait tracks how many frames are outstanding; \
go-back-N tracks a window base and a next sequence number.
g) A switch has an ID and a MAC table size, and maintains any number of MAC \
table entries. An entry pairs an address with a port number and an age, and is \
discarded when the switch is powered off.
h) A switch forwards through two or more network interfaces. Those interfaces \
are physical hardware and survive a switch being reconfigured."""

a) A client host obtains its address configuration through a DHCP relay agent \

never contacts the DHCP server directly.
b) The DHCP server provides ILeaseAllocation, and the relay presents that same \
interface onward to clients.
c) The DHCP server reads its address pools from an IPAM database. No other \
component may read that database.
d) A client resolves names through a DNS resolver, which provides \
INameResolution. The resolver in turn queries the authoritative DNS servers \
through IZoneQuery.
e) When the DHCP server issues a lease it registers the name through the same \
IZoneQuery interface the resolver uses.
f) A client synchronises its clock through the NTP server's ITimeSync interface \
and authenticates through the RADIUS server's IAuthentication interface.
g) The RADIUS server looks users up in the directory service through \
IIdentityLookup.
h) The DHCP server, DNS resolver, RADIUS server and NTP server all send events \

Database Requirements Collection Process

A data architect is documenting how requirements for a new database are \
collected, so that no project skips a source of truth.

a) The team first agrees the scope and identifies the stakeholders.
b) Three fact-finding activities then run: interviewing stakeholders, examining \
the existing forms and reports, and observing current working practice. They are \
independent -- they may happen in any order or at the same time -- and the work \
proceeds only when all three are complete.
c) The findings are consolidated into a data dictionary.
d) If two sources define the same item differently, the conflict is resolved \
with the data owners and consolidation is redone. This may happen any number of \
times.
e) Once the dictionary is consistent, a conceptual model is drafted and \
validated with the stakeholders.
f) If the stakeholders do not accept the model, it is revised and validated \
again -- fact-finding is not repeated.
g) When they accept it, the model is signed off and baselined, and the process \
ends."""

"Arcus Payments" - Ports and Adapters Architecture

Arcus wants its payment logic testable without a database, a bank or a mail \
server. Model the component structure that makes that possible.

a) The payment domain core holds all the business logic. It provides one \
inbound interface, IPaymentUseCase.
b) Three inbound adapters drive the core through that one interface: a REST \
adapter, a batch file adapter and a message adapter. None of them contains \
business logic, and none knows about any other.
c) The core defines three outbound ports: IPaymentRepository for storage, \
IAuthorisationPort for card authorisation and INotificationPort for customer \
notification.
d) Each outbound port has exactly one adapter implementing it: a JPA \
persistence adapter, an acquirer HTTP adapter and an e-mail notify adapter.
e) The persistence adapter talks to the payment database, the acquirer adapter \
to the acquirer bank, and the notify adapter to an SMTP relay. The core talks to \
none of those three directly.
f) The core depends on nothing outside itself except the three port interfaces \
that it declares.
g) No adapter depends on another adapter."""

CFG35_I = """\
1. Draw every component in requirements (a) to (e) as a UML component.
2. Show each provided interface as a lollipop on the component that provides \
it, and each required interface as a dependency from the component that needs it.
3. Name every interface on the arrow that uses it. Do not draw an unnamed \
dependency.
4. Requirement (f) is the point of the whole architecture. Explain in one \
sentence how the core can call the database while depending only on an \
interface it declares itself, and name the principle that describes it.
5. Requirement (b) has three adapters on one interface. State what you would \
have to change to add a scheduled-job adapter, and what you would have to change \
in the CORE -- then say what that answer tells you about the design."""
