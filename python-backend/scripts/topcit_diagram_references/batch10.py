d) A document is issued as one or more revisions, each with a revision code, an \
issue date and a status. A revision is shaped by exactly one template.
e) A revision is structured into one or more sections, each with a heading and \
an ordinal. A section may nest within another section of the same revision, to \
any depth; a top-level section nests within none.
f) A locale has a language tag and a name, and is a standing list.
g) A revision is translated as any number of translations, each targeting \
exactly one locale and recording a translation date and a status.
h) A translation is published as any number of distributions, each with a \

Thornbury translates manuals into eleven languages, and errors in the English \
source have twice been translated eleven times before anyone noticed. Model the \
process so that cannot happen.

a) The source revision is frozen. If it is not yet approved for translation, the \
work is held until it is.
b) The translatable content is extracted, and the translation memory is applied \
to reuse previously translated segments.
c) Three activities then run: translating the new segments, checking against the \
terminology glossary, and adapting the layout for the target locale. They are \
independent and may run in any order or at the same time; review waits until all \
three are complete.
d) An in-country native speaker reviews the translation for language.
e) If it is not linguistically accepted, the translation is corrected and \
reviewed again.
f) A technical review then checks it against the source.
g) If it is not technically faithful, the team asks whether the SOURCE itself is \
at fault. If it is, the process returns to freezing a corrected source. If it is \
not, it is a translation error and goes back to correction.
h) Once technically faithful it is published and the translation memory updated, \
and the process ends."""

"Verity Ventures" - Business Plan Class Model

Verity reviews business plans for investors. Every plan models subscription and \
one-off revenue with different code, so the two cannot be totalled. Model the \
classes so they can.

a) A business plan has an ID, a title, a horizon in years and a status, and can \
report its break-even month and whether it is fundable.
b) A plan is written as one or more plan sections, each with a heading and an \
ordinal. A section has no meaning apart from its plan.
c) A plan is supported by one or more financial forecasts, each with a \
preparation date, able to report net margin and cumulative cash for a given \
month. Forecasts are deleted with the plan.
d) Every revenue stream has an ID, a name and the month it starts in, and can \
report its revenue for a given month.
e) Subscription and one-off streams are both revenue streams, and a bare stream \
is never instantiated. A subscription stream adds a monthly price and a churn \
rate; a one-off stream adds a unit price and units per month. Each provides its \
own monthlyRevenue().
f) A forecast projects one or more revenue streams. A stream is meaningless \
apart from its forecast.
g) Every cost line has an ID and a name and can report its cost for a given \
month and whether it is discretionary.
h) Fixed and variable costs are both cost lines, and a bare cost line is never \
instantiated. A fixed cost adds a monthly amount; a variable cost adds a rate \
per unit.
i) A forecast absorbs one or more cost lines, and rests on one or more \
assumptions, each with a statement and a confidence rating. Both are deleted \
with the forecast.
j) A plan carries any number of risks, each with a description, likelihood and \
impact."""

Ravensworth's planning tool treats summary tasks, work packages and milestones \

b) Every work element has an ID, a name and planned days, and can report its \
duration and percentage complete.
c) Summary tasks, work packages and milestones are all work elements, and a \
bare work element is never instantiated. A summary task adds a rollup method; a \
work package adds a deliverable reference and a percentage done; a milestone \
adds a due date and an achieved date. Each provides its own duration().
d) A project is planned as one or more work elements. An element has no meaning \
apart from its project.
e) A summary task rolls up one or more work elements -- which may themselves be \
summary tasks, to any depth. Those children are destroyed with their parent.
f) A work element is linked by any number of dependencies, each with a link type \
and a lag in days.
g) Every resource has an ID, a name and a cost per day, and can report its \
availability on a date.
h) People and equipment are both resources, and a bare resource is never \
instantiated. A person adds a grade and skills; equipment adds an asset tag and \
a service date.
i) A work package is staffed by any number of assignments, each with an \
allocation percentage and a date range. Assignments are deleted with the work \
package.

"Ravensworth Consulting" - Requirement Allocation and Interfaces

Ravensworth builds systems from subsystems supplied by different teams, and \
nobody can say which team owns a given requirement or which subsystems an \
interface joins. Model the data.

a) A system has a name and belongs to exactly one project.
b) A system is composed of one or more subsystems, each with a name. A subsystem \
may contain other subsystems to any depth; a top-level subsystem is contained by \
none. A subsystem does not survive its system.
c) Each subsystem is the responsibility of exactly one owner. Owners have a name \
and a discipline and remain on file after a subsystem is retired.
d) A system specifies one or more requirements, each with a reference, text and \
a level (system, subsystem, component).
e) A requirement is allocated by any number of allocations. Each allocates it to \
exactly one subsystem and records the allocation type and date. A subsystem may \
receive many allocations.
f) An allocation apportions any number of budget allocations, each naming a \
parameter with a value and a unit -- mass, power, latency and so on.
g) A requirement may be the parent of any number of other requirements. Each \
decomposition records the rationale.
h) A system defines any number of interfaces, each with a name and a type.
i) An interface joins two or more interface endpoints. Each endpoint terminates \
at exactly one subsystem and records that subsystem's role.
j) An interface is governed by any number of interface requirements, each \
referring to exactly one requirement and recording a protocol and a data format."""

Technical Webinar Platform - Use Cases

A team is specifying a platform for technical webinars, and must be clear about \
who does what and which systems sit outside it. Model it.

a) A host schedules a webinar and moderates questions.
b) A presenter uploads the slide deck and delivers the session.
c) An attendee registers to attend and asks questions.
d) Delivering the session ALWAYS shares the screen and ALWAYS records the \
session.
e) Delivering the session runs a live poll ONLY when the presenter has prepared \
one. Most sessions do not.
f) Asking a question ALWAYS goes through moderation before it reaches the \
presenter.
g) Scheduling a webinar sends follow-up material ONLY when the host has enabled \
it.
h) The content repository is a separate system that stores uploaded decks. The \
CRM system is a separate system that receives registrations and follow-up \
records. Neither is part of the platform and no person uses either here."""

Model the response process so that cannot recur.

politely, records why, and the process ends there.
c) A response owner is appointed, and every question is read and mapped to the \
person who will answer it.
d) Three drafting activities then run: the technical answers, the commercial \
answers, and assembling references and case studies. They are independent and may \
be done in any order or at the same time; consolidation waits until all three are \
complete.
e) The answers are consolidated into one voice.
f) If any question is unanswered, the gap is filled or a clarification requested, \
and consolidation is redone.
g) The response is reviewed for accuracy AND for any commitment it makes.
h) If it contains a commitment nobody has approved, that commitment is removed \
or escalated for approval, and the review is repeated.
i) The response is submitted before the deadline, and the process ends."""

a) A product has a name and is owned by exactly one product owner. Owners remain \
on file after a product is retired.
b) A product is delivered through one or more epics, each with a title, an \
outcome and a status. An epic has no meaning apart from its product.
c) An epic is broken into one or more user stories, each with a reference, a \
goal, a benefit and an estimate in points.
d) A persona has a name and a description and is a shared list. Each story names \
exactly one persona as its role; a persona appears in many stories.
e) A story is accepted by one or more acceptance criteria, each with an ordinal, \
a given-when-then statement and a mandatory flag. Criteria are deleted with the \
story.
f) A story may block any number of other stories. Each dependency records the \
reason.
g) A product defines any number of glossary terms, each with a term and a \
definition.
h) A story may refer to any number of glossary terms, and a term may be referred \
to by many stories.
i) A sprint has a name and a start and end date and belongs to exactly one \
product.
j) A sprint commits any number of stories. Each commitment records the points \
committed and the completion date, which is empty if the story did not finish. \
One story may be committed to several sprints over time."""
