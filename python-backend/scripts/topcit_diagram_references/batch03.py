"Kestrel Retail" Storefront Component Architecture

Kestrel is splitting a retail monolith into services and needs the component \
structure agreed before any code is written.

a) Two front ends exist: a web storefront UI and a mobile app backend-for-\
frontend. Neither talks to a service directly; both go through an API gateway, \
which is the only component they know about.
b) The gateway provides the IStorefront interface to those two front ends.
c) The gateway depends on three services: a catalog service (ICatalogQuery), a \
basket service (IBasket) and an order service (IOrderPlacement). Each service \
provides exactly that one interface to the gateway.
d) The catalog service checks stock through the inventory service's IStockCheck \
interface.
e) The basket service prices its lines through the catalog service's \
ICatalogQuery interface -- the same interface the gateway uses, not a second one.
f) The order service authorises payment through the payment service \
(IPaymentAuth), reserves stock through IStockCheck, tells the notification \
service to send a dispatch notice (IDispatchNotice), and persists to its own \
order database. No other component may reach that database.
g) No service calls the gateway, and no service calls a front end."""

it, and each required interface as a dependency from the component that needs it.

dependency.
4. Requirement (e) says the basket service reuses ICatalogQuery. Show that one \
interface serving two consumers, and explain in one sentence why defining a \
second interface for the same operation would be a design fault.
5. Requirements (f) and (g) constrain the direction of dependencies. State what \
architectural property they are protecting, and identify which single component \
would become a bottleneck if requirement (g) were relaxed."""

Kestrel's team needs the runtime interaction for placing an order agreed before \
the services are built. Model one successful and one failing path in a single \
diagram.

a) The customer starts checkout in the storefront UI, which calls the order \
service with the basket identifier.
b) The order service first asks the inventory service to reserve the stock, and \
waits for the answer before doing anything else.
c) If stock is available, the order service asks the payment service to \
authorise the amount and waits for the result.
d) A declined authorisation is retried up to three times. The customer is not \
asked again between retries.
e) On a successful authorisation the order service tells the notification \
service to send a confirmation. It does NOT wait for the notification to be \
sent -- the order is complete either way.
f) If stock is not available, or if all three authorisation attempts are \
declined, the order service releases any reserved stock and no confirmation is \
sent.

displays it to the customer."""

a) A customer has a name, credit limit and an on-hold flag, and places any \

remain on file after their orders are archived.
b) An order consists of one or more order lines, each naming a product with a \
quantity and the unit price at the time of the order. A line has no meaning \
apart from its order.
c) A product has an SKU, name and unit weight, and appears on many order lines.
d) A supplier offers products under supply agreements, each recording the cost \
and a minimum order quantity. A supplier offers many products, and a product \
may be offered by many suppliers.
e) A warehouse holds a stock level per product, recording the quantity on hand \
and a reorder point. A stock level cannot exist without its warehouse.
f) An order is fulfilled by any number of shipments -- a partial delivery is \
normal. Each shipment is despatched from exactly one warehouse and records the \
despatch date and carrier.

exactly one order line and records how many units of it were shipped. One order \

a) Every customer, company and broker on the system is a party, with an ID, a \

b) A party is either a person -- with a date of birth and a national ID -- or \
an organisation, with a registration number and a sector. No party is only a \
party, and none is both.
c) A policy has a start date, end date and premium, and is held by exactly one \
party. A party may hold many policies over time.
d) A policy is either a motor policy -- with a vehicle registration and \
no-claims years -- or a home policy, with a property address and a rebuild \
value. The shared attributes must not be repeated in both.
e) A policy provides one or more cover items, each naming a peril with a sum \
insured and an excess. Cover items are deleted with the policy.
f) A policy is claimed against any number of times. A claim records the report \
date, a status and a reserve, and settles through any number of claim payments.
g) Some parties act as agents, holding an agency code and a commission rate. A \
party acts as at most one agent, and most parties are not agents at all.
