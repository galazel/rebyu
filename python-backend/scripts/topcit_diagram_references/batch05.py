Halcyon must show an auditor which version of the specification a given \
requirement appeared in, and who approved it. Model the specification document \
itself.

a) A specification has a title and a status and belongs to exactly one project.
b) A specification is issued as one or more versions, each with a version \
number, an issue date and a flag saying whether it is a baseline. A version has \
no meaning apart from its specification.
c) A version is structured into one or more sections, each with a heading and \
an ordinal. A section belongs to exactly one version.
d) A section may nest within another section of the same version, to any depth. \
A top-level section nests within none.
e) A section states any number of requirement statements, each with a \
reference, its text and the modal verb used ("shall", "should", "may"). A \
statement is deleted with its section.
f) A requirement kind -- functional, performance, security, and so on -- \
classifies many statements. Kinds are defined once for the organisation and \
outlive any specification.
g) A version defines any number of glossary terms. A requirement statement may \
refer to any number of terms, and a term may be referred to by many statements.
h) A version records any number of assumptions, each flagged as an assumption \
or a constraint.
i) A version receives approvals. Each approval is given by exactly one author \
and records the date and the decision. Authors stay on file between projects."""

A design authority is documenting how a system is broken into modules and how \
that decomposition is judged.

a) The designer reads the design requirements, then decomposes the system into \
candidate modules.
b) Two assessments then run: measuring the cohesion of each module and \
measuring the coupling between modules. They are independent and may be done in \
either order or at the same time; judgement waits until both are complete.
c) If any module's cohesion is unacceptable, that module is split and the \
decomposition is done again.
d) If coupling between modules is unacceptable, an interface is introduced to \
decouple them and the decomposition is done again.
e) When both are acceptable, each module's interface contract is specified.
f) The decomposition is peer reviewed. If the review fails, the team returns to \
decomposition. If it passes, the module structure is baselined and the process \
ends."""

procedure from a standing list, and records when it was performed and any notes.
g) A visit issues any number of prescriptions. Each names exactly one drug with \

"Kestrel Retail" - Sales Reporting Warehouse

Kestrel's reports take minutes to run against the normalised order tables, and \
a product moved to a new category last year has silently rewritten two years of \
history. Model a dimensional schema that fixes both.

a) The grain of the fact table is one row per product per sale transaction. \
Each row records the quantity, the net amount and the tax amount.
b) The fact table is dated by a date dimension holding the calendar date, month \
name, quarter, fiscal year and a holiday flag. Dates are generated in advance, \
so a date row exists whether or not any sale used it.
c) A product dimension describes each fact row, holding the product's business \
ID, name and category.
d) A store dimension locates each fact row, and a customer dimension identifies \
it. A store holds a region; a customer holds a segment.
e) A promotion dimension attributes each fact row, holding a promotion code, \
name and discount percentage.
f) Product, store and customer must keep history: when a product's category \
changes, sales before the change must still report under the old category. Each \
of those three carries a validFrom, a validTo and a current-row flag, and a new \
row is inserted rather than the old one updated.
g) The promotion dimension does not keep history -- a corrected promotion name \
should apply everywhere.
h) A basket-level bridge breaks each sale out across the products in it, \
carrying a weighting factor so that basket-level measures are not double counted."""

1. Identify the fact table and the dimension tables, marking primary keys (PK) \
and foreign keys (FK). Say explicitly what the grain of the fact table is.
2. Draw every relationship with its cardinality at BOTH ends, arranging the \
dimensions around the fact table.
3. Requirement (f) describes a slowly changing dimension. Name its type, show \
the three columns that implement it, and explain in one sentence how a query \
finds the row that was current on the date of a sale.
4. Requirement (g) is a different type from requirement (f). Name it, and state \
in one sentence why a promotion NAME and a product CATEGORY are treated \
differently.
5. Requirement (b) says a date row exists whether or not any sale used it. State \
in one sentence what report that makes possible, and what would be wrong with a \
zero-sales day if dates were only inserted when a sale occurred."""
