"Pellworth Bank" - Security Principles Class Model

Pellworth's code treats a human login, a service account and a device as three \
unrelated things, so an access check is written three times. Model the classes \
so it is written once.

a) Every subject has a subject ID, a display name and an active flag, and can \
authenticate with a credential and describe itself.
b) There are three kinds of subject and nothing is ever just a subject. A human \
user adds an employee number and a last password change date; a service account \
adds an owning team and a rotation period; a device identity adds a serial and \
an attestation reference. Each provides its own authenticate().
c) Every credential has an ID, an issue date and an expiry date, and can report \
whether it is expired and how strong it is.
d) Password credentials and certificate credentials are both credentials, and a \
bare credential is never instantiated. A password credential adds a hash and an \
algorithm; a certificate credential adds a serial and an issuer DN.
e) A subject holds one or more credentials. A credential has no meaning apart \
from its subject and is destroyed with it.
f) An asset has an ID, a name and a classification, and can report whether it \
must be encrypted and how long it is retained.
g) An asset is protected by one or more permissions, each with an action and a \
scope. Permissions are defined centrally and survive the asset being archived.
h) A subject is given any number of grants. Each conveys exactly one permission \
and records when it was granted and when it expires. Grants are deleted with the \
subject.
i) A subject generates any number of audit events, each recording a timestamp \
and an outcome, and each concerning exactly one asset."""

1. Identify the classes and their attributes, with data types and visibility \
(+ public, - private, # protected).
2. Add at least two operations per class, with parameters and return types.
3. Draw the relationships with multiplicities at BOTH ends, choosing correctly \
between association, aggregation, composition and generalisation.
4. Justify in one sentence each: why Subject-Credential and Subject-Grant are \
