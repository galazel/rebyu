b) The rating engine depends on IRatedUsage and on the product catalogue's \

c) The rating engine provides IChargeSet.
d) The billing engine depends on IChargeSet and on the customer account \

e) The invoice generator depends on IChargeSet -- the same interface the billing \

f) The invoice generator posts to the general ledger.
g) The collections manager depends on IInvoiceDocument and IAccountLookup.

d) Resources are assigned to tasks.
e) If any resource is over-allocated, that resource is levelled.

critical path is recalculated from scratch. If it has not, the over-allocation \
check is repeated for the next resource.
g) When no resource is over-allocated, the schedule is baselined.
