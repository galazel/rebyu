"""Large question sets are generated in batches, not one giant call.

A 50-item mock exam wants roughly 12k completion tokens now that every MCQ
explains all four choices, against the question task's `ai_question_max_tokens`
ceiling. The response was truncated, a truncated tool call is malformed, malformed output is
retried with backoff -- and the Java gateway's 120s read timeout fired first:

    io.netty.handler.timeout.ReadTimeoutException
    AiServiceException: Fetch pending review for run ... failed

Batching keeps each call inside the ceiling. Deduplication is the price: a
later batch cannot see the earlier ones, and a live 30-question run came back
with only 20 distinct stems.
