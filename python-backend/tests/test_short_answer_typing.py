"""SHORT_ANSWER must have one specific answer; open-ended belongs to DESCRIPTIVE.

SHORT_ANSWER is graded by normalised exact string match
(`app.domain.persistence.checking_method_for` maps it to EXACT_MATCH), so an

string the learner types will match. A live run produced

which is a perfectly good question of the wrong type. It is reclassified rather
