"""Screening of model output before it enters a run.

Everything an agent writes reaches a learner, so secrets lifted out of an
uploaded document, instructions echoed back from an injected PDF, and content
about the wrong subject all have to be stopped before a reviewer sees them.

The blocking mechanism is deliberately the existing one: `GuardrailViolation`
is a `ValueError`, which `app.ai.retry` already treats as malformed output and
resamples. So a violation costs a sample, not a run.
