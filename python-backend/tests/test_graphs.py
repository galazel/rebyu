"""LangGraph structure, routing, reducer, and node tests.

These exist because of Phase 2a step 3. Previously the graph modules built
themselves at import scope and each agent module constructed a Groq client at
import scope, so *any* test touching a graph required both a live Postgres and
a GROQ_API_KEY -- which is why there were zero tests for graphs, agents, or
tools despite them being the core of the product.

Everything here runs against an InMemorySaver with stubbed agents.
