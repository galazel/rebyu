"""Live workflow timeline over websocket (Phase 2b step 14).

The contract these lock down:
  * a client always gets a DB-backed snapshot first, so a reconnect after a
    dropped connection or a server restart never loses history;
  * `last_seq` replays only what was missed;
  * live events arrive without polling;
  * the stream closes itself once the run reaches a terminal state.
