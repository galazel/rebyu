 * One certification's assessments, on its own page.

 * curriculum -- a table you search, filter and open rows of, reachable only by
 * scrolling past everything else on a page about something else. The question
 * bank was moved out for the same reason and this is the same frame: a header
 * that says which certification you are in, a way back, and the workspace.
 *
 * <p>The publishing checklist stays behind on the certification page, because
 * what it is really about is whether the certification can go live. Its
 * "Create ..." buttons now navigate here and hand the request over in router
 * state, so the flow from a missing requirement to the dialog that fills it is
 * the one it always was, one page further along.
