/**
 * One certification's question bank, on its own page.
 *
 * <p>It was a tab beside Curriculum and Assessments, which put a library you
 * filter, scan and open rows of inside a container sized for a page you read.
 * The table was capped, the filters competed with the certification header for
 * the top of the screen, and every scroll was two scrolls -- the page's and the
 * tab's. A library is a workspace: it gets the viewport.
 *
 * <p>The bank itself is the same component the tab rendered, in its
 * un-embedded form. This page is a frame around it -- a header and a way back
 * -- so questions authored, edited or deleted here go through exactly the paths
 * they always have.
