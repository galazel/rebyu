          i.e. GET /api/institution/me/group-stats); they were taken out because
          with one learner at 0% progress they had nothing to show yet, not
          because anything was wrong with them.

          To restore: re-add the `groupStatsQuery` useQuery for
          `getInstitutionGroupStats`, the `completionMix` bucketing derived from
          it, and the two BentoTile charts. Full markup is in git history for
