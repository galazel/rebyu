/**
 * Fixture attempt for the dev-only screenshot harness.
 *
 * Shaped exactly like the `AttemptDto` the backend returns from
 * POST /learner/assessments/{id}/attempts, so the real attempt page renders it
 * without knowing it is not talking to a server. Same contract the arena run
 * fixtures follow (`components/challenges/arena-run-fixtures.js`).
 *
 * It exists so the landing hero can carry screenshots of the genuine
 * assessment workspace — real components, real CSS — rather than a hand-built
 * lookalike that drifts from the product every time the attempt page changes.
 *
 * The five showcased items sit at indices 11-15 inside a 24-item exam: the
 * navigator grid only looks like a real mock exam when there are real items
 * around the one on screen.
