/**
 * Dev-only screenshot harness for the assessment attempt page.
 *
 * Renders the REAL `LearnerAssessmentAttemptPage` — no fork, no lookalike —
 * against a fixture attempt, so the landing hero can carry screenshots of the
 * environment learners actually sit exams in. When the attempt page changes,
 * re-shooting the hero is a matter of reopening this route.
 *
 * Nothing here reaches the network: an axios adapter answers the attempt
 * endpoints locally, and the learner identity is seeded into localStorage so
 * the page never asks who is signed in. The route is registered behind
 * `import.meta.env.DEV` in `App.jsx`, so it does not exist in a production
 * bundle.
