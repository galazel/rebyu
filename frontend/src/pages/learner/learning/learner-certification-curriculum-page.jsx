/**
 * The curriculum a learner lands on after opening an enrolled certification.
 *
 * A road, not a table of contents.
 *
 * This was a stack of unit bands, each opening an accordion of topics, each
 * opening a list of lessons -- three levels of disclosure between arriving and
 * pressing the thing you came to press, and no answer at all to "where was I?"
 * without opening them. The curriculum is a sequence, so it is drawn as one:
 * every topic and exam is a stop on a dotted trail that swings down the page,
 * a sticky banner names the unit whose stretch you are in, and the first
 * unfinished stop carries a start bubble.
 *
 * A stop is a single target with a single action -- a topic opens the topic
 * surface, an exam opens the attempt. The lessons and quizzes inside a topic
 * are not repeated here: the topic page is where they live, and listing them
 * twice is what made this page a directory in the first place.
 *
 * The road is walked in order. A unit opens only once every unit above it is
 * finished, so unit two stands grey while unit one still has lessons in it.
 * Ordering used to be a suggestion here -- but the order is the whole output of
 * the diagnostic, and a priority order nobody has to follow is a ranking, not a
 * plan. Before the diagnostic the entire road is locked. Either way a locked
 * stop shakes when pressed and names the gate holding it.
 *
 * Every unit is on screen at once: one continuous scroll from the first topic
 * to the final. No accordion, no "show all units" -- a road you have to unroll
 * a section at a time is a table of contents wearing a path, and the lock is
 * what keeps the whole thing from reading as a wall.
 *
 * Nothing on it is a card. Units are separated by a rule and a name in the
 * unit's colour, not by a slab you press to open; the only objects on the page
 * are the stops themselves.

                `node.art` is the seam for real illustration. Nothing sets it

                component. Kept out of the state branches deliberately: a topic
                that is done or locked still shows its own object, and the
                plinth beneath it is what carries the state. */}

 * control: the stops are the only things on this page you press, and the unit
 * is a caption over the stretch they belong to.
 *

 * stops down has no other way to know which unit they are in. It paints the
 * page's own ground rather than sitting on a transparent offset, so the nodes
 * disappear cleanly behind it instead of sliding through a gap above it. The
 * offset clears the one sticky thing above it -- the portal nav (`top-0`, 4rem).
 *

 * soft washes of the palette's own colours placed away from the trail so they
 * never sit behind a node's label.
 *
 * Fixed rather than scrolled, so the road travels through it instead of
 * dragging it along -- the stops move, the ground stays, which is what makes a
 * long scroll feel like distance covered.
 *
 * Every colour is a `--color-rb-*` token, so the dark theme's overrides apply
 * to this for free. Opacities are deliberately far below the nodes': this has
 * to survive being looked past, and a backdrop that competes with the stop a
 * learner is trying to read is worse than no backdrop.
