/**
 * A confetti burst, on a canvas, with no dependency behind it.
 *
 * `@tsparticles/*` is already installed and could do this, but it is a general
 * particle engine configured through a large options object and mounted as a
 * React tree of its own -- several hundred KB and a container lifecycle to
 * manage, for one burst of paper that lives two seconds. The whole effect is
 * "spawn N rectangles, apply gravity and drag, rotate, fade", which is the
 * function below.
 *
 * Drawn into a portal at <body>, not inside whatever opened it. The award modal
 * is the caller, and Radix centres its content with a `translate` -- a
 * transformed ancestor becomes the containing block for `position: fixed`, so a
 * canvas rendered inside the dialog would be pinned to the dialog's box and
 * clipped to it rather than covering the viewport.
 *
 * The colours are the design system's tone solids: the same set the bubble
 * cards, badges and buttons are drawn in, so the paper belongs to the product
 * rather than arriving from a library's default palette.
