/**
 * REBYU motion primitives.
 *
 * The design system already had a motion layer in `rebyu-ds.css` — `rb-pop-in`,
 * `rb-rise`, `rb-reveal` — for things CSS can do on its own. This module covers
 * what it cannot: entrances that need to know when an element scrolled into
 * view, lists that stagger, accordions that animate to `height: auto`, and
 * numbers that count. Reach for the CSS classes first; use these when the
 * animation depends on state or timing.
 *
 * Two rules hold everything together:
 *
 * 1. **One easing curve.** `EASE` is the same cubic-bezier the CSS layer uses,
 *    so a card that reveals with JS and a bar that fills with CSS decelerate
 *    identically. Mixing curves is what makes an interface feel assembled from
 *    parts.
 *
 * 2. **Reduced motion is not this module's job.** `<MotionConfig
 *    reducedMotion="user">` wraps the app in `main.jsx`, which makes every
 *    animation here collapse to an opacity change automatically. Checking the
 *    media query in each component would be four more places to forget.
 *
 * Nothing here animates layout-affecting properties on scroll except height on
 * an accordion the user just opened — transform and opacity only, so a long
 * curriculum page does not repaint on every frame.
