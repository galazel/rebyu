/**
 * What a portal shows while the next page's code is still arriving.
 *
 * This exists because the app had one `<Suspense>` around the entire route
 * tree, with the boot screen as its fallback. Every navigation therefore tore
 * down the whole shell -- nav, sidebar, the lot -- and replaced it with a
 * full-screen animated splash, for however long the lazy chunk took. Moving the
 * boundary inside each layout keeps the chrome painted and confines the wait to
 * the one region that is actually changing.
 *
 * Deliberately generic. A route fallback cannot know which page is coming, so
 * anything shaped like a specific page would be a lie on every other route --
 * a dashboard's four stat tiles standing in for a settings form. It promises
 * only what is always true: a heading, then content. The moment the page's own
 * code lands, its `isLoading` skeleton takes over with the accurate shape.
 *
 * No animation beyond the shimmer the `Skeleton` primitive already carries.
 * This is on screen for a few hundred milliseconds; anything that has to build
 * up to look right would only ever be seen half-built.
