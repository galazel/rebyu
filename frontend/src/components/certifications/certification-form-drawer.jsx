/* Creating only.
   This drawer used to do double duty: a one-page create form, and a two-step
   edit form carrying a whole category tree. Editing now happens on the
   certification page itself, where every name is edited where it is shown and
   each level adds and removes its own items -- so the second mode, its step
   navigation, and the tree editor behind it are gone rather than left as a
   second way to do the same thing. Two editors writing the same rows through
   two different payload builders is how one of them quietly starts wiping what
   the other remembered to send.

   What is left is what generation actually needs: what the certification is,
   and the documents to read. */

   The graph was written review-first: it pauses after the curriculum, after
   every category, after every lesson, and again for each exam and the question
   bank. That is right when someone intends to shape the material as it is
   written, and wrong the rest of the time — an unattended run stops at the
   first checkpoint and waits, so "start it and check back later" produced a
   certification that had generated one thing and then sat still.

               belongs -- and leaves the admin free to start the next one.

               guard refuses to close while a mutation is in flight: whether

                        reading each PDF, pulling its figures out and storing
                        them -- reports nothing, because it all happens inside
                        the one request and nothing comes back until it ends.

                        That silence is the whole problem: the bar sat full and
                        the button said "Starting…" for minutes, which is what a
                        crashed request looks like too, so the honest reading
                        was that it had died.

                        So the second phase shows elapsed time instead of a
                        percentage. A number that keeps moving is proof the
                        request is alive, and no percentage is invented for work
                        that cannot be measured from here -- a bar creeping to
                        90% and stopping would be a lie that looks worse the
                        longer it holds. */}
