// `border-rb-swan` / `rounded-rb-card` / `font-rb-display` measure identically
// in and out of the scope. What is genuinely scoped is the *component* layer
// -- `.rb-chip`, `.rb-btn`, `.rb-card`, `.rb-display` -- which goes inert
// outside `.rebyu-ds` (transparent, `display: block`). Never reach for those
// here; the utilities are fine, and the accordion and tabs blocks use them to

 */
//: `p-6` is the gap between the picture and the panel edge. It has to be
//: explicit and generous because the media is `h-full w-full`: it fills the
//: content box exactly, so the padding is the *only* thing separating it from
//: the frame. At `p-4` against an image with a pale background of its own the
//: two read as one edge-to-edge block with no frame at all.
//:
//: The panel keeps DialogContent's own surface -- `bg-popover`, border, rounded
//: corners, shadow. An earlier version stripped all three to `bg-transparent`,
//: which looked right only for an image that happened to fill the box exactly:
//: `object-contain` letterboxes everything else, and with no background those
//: bands showed the dimmed lesson page straight through. An image with its own
//: alpha channel washed out against it too. A viewer needs a surface to sit on.
//:
//: `place-items-center` because DialogContent is a grid: its only in-flow child
//: is the media (the title and close control are `sr-only`, so absolutely
//: positioned and out of flow), and centring it explicitly avoids depending on
//: how a stretched item resolves `h-full` inside an auto-sized row.
//: `!max-w-none` is important-flagged to beat the base `sm:max-w-lg` -- that is
//: a different variant group, so tailwind-merge does not treat it as a conflict
//: and would otherwise leave it applied above 640px.
//:
//: Every one of the panel's own decorations is turned off. A diagram opened to
//: be read does not want a card around it: the border, the popover fill, the
//: padding, the rounding and the drop shadow all drew a second frame inside the
//: viewport and shrank the picture to make room for it. What is left is the

//:
//: `h-full w-full` was the obvious spelling and it silently failed. The panel's
//: single grid row is auto-sized, so the browser sizes the row from its content
//: while the content asks for 100% of the row: a cycle. The percentage resolves
//: to `auto`, the row grows to the image's intrinsic height -- 1200px for a
//: lesson diagram -- and the picture spills straight out of a panel fixed at
//: 660px, uncropped, over the page behind it. It only looked correct for images
//: that happened to be smaller than the panel already.
//:
//: Absolute caps have no such cycle: the image is never asked how big it is in
//: terms of a box whose size depends on the answer. `overflow-hidden` on the
//: panel above is the backstop -- if any future image escapes its cap, it is
//: clipped to the frame instead of covering the lesson.
//: The media fills the viewport short of a margin, rather than a fixed box.
//: The absolute caps the previous panel needed are gone with it: `dvh`/`vw` are
