 * Adds to a certification that already exists.

 * <p>Deliberately not the same control as "generate": that path clears the
 * curriculum first, which is right for a rebuild and destructive for an
 * addition. An admin who uploaded four of five handbooks, or whose syllabus
 * grew a domain, wants the fifth added -- not the four they already paid to
 * author thrown away along with every question and assessment hanging off
 * them.
 *
 * <p>The dialog says that plainly, because "generate" appearing twice on one
 * page with opposite consequences is exactly the kind of thing an admin only
 * discovers afterwards.
