/**
 * The arena card, generalised.
 *
 * The challenge carousel's card is the shape the product liked: a saturated
 * gradient cap with two translucent bubbles behind a circular icon medallion,
 * sitting on a body in the matching pastel wash. This module is that card with
 * its content knocked out, so any page can use it without re-inventing the
 * gradient or guessing which wash goes with which accent.
 *
 * A tone is a matched set — gradient cap, body wash, and the ink that stays
 * legible on that wash. Pick a tone per entity, never per rank or value, so the
 * same thing keeps the same colour across pages.
 *
 * `solid` is the tone at a weight that carries text and small shapes: a filled
 * button label, a progress fill against its track. The cap's own colours are
 * chosen to look good under white icon art at 80px and are far too light for
 * either — white on macaw is 2.4:1, and a cyan bar on a #F1F1F1 track is
 * 2.1:1. Each `solid` is the darkest point in its own hue that still clears
 * 4.5:1 both ways against white, so it works as a face under white text and as
 * text on the card.

 *                  the only thing that can tell them apart is their name.
 * @param body      "wash" (default) paints the body in the tone's pastel; "card"
 *                  leaves it on the plain card surface, so the tone is carried
 *                  by the cap alone — the shape the certification cards use.

         drew a blue halo on focus.

         Two of these are variable *overrides* rather than new properties, and
         that is the point. A `focus-visible:ring-[…]` class does not fix the
         halo: it lands in the same `--tw-ring-color` slot as the base
         `ring-ring/35`, which is emitted later in the sheet and wins on order.
         `--rb-focus` is worse still — the design system focuses every button
         through `:root [data-slot=button]:focus-visible`, which no utility
         class can outrank. Redefining what those rules resolve to sidesteps the
