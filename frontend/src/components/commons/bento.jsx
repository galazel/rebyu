/**
 * Bento layout primitives.
 *
 * A bento is a mosaic, not a grid of equal boxes: tile size is what says which
 * number matters. The grid runs on a six-column track with a fixed base row, so
 * a tile can claim 1–6 columns and 1–4 rows and still land on the same rhythm.
 *
 * ONE RULE when composing a grid: work in *bands* whose columns add up to six,
 * and write the tiles in reading order within each band. Auto-placement cannot
 * invent a tile to plug a hole, so a band that adds up to five leaves a ragged
 * gap that drags every band below it out of alignment. A band may be
 * 2+4, 4+2, 2+2+2, 3+3, 6, or a wide tile beside a stack (4 + [1+1] + 2) —
 * vary them, that alternation is what makes the mosaic read as designed.
 *
 * Colour is the other half of it. A `tone` fills the whole tile with that
 * accent's wash and prints its ink on top — the same tone set the arena cards
 * use, so a filled tile and a bubble card are recognisably the same family.
