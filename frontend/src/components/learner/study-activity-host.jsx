/**
 * Runs the learner's scheduled study activities when their time comes.
 *
 * <p>Mounted once, beside the router's pages rather than inside one, so a
 * session fires whatever the learner happens to be reading. A page cannot own
 * this: the whole point is that the learner did not navigate anywhere to make
 * it happen.
 *
 * <h3>What "automatic" can actually mean</h3>
 * A browser tab cannot wake itself. If REBYU is not open at 7:00 PM, nothing
 * fires at 7:00 PM — no amount of client code changes that, and only a push
 * notification or a native app would. So a session is due from its scheduled
 * time onwards rather than exactly at it, and an open tab picks up anything
 * that came due while it was closed. A missed session surfaces the moment the
 * learner comes back instead of being silently skipped, which is the honest
 * reading of "the learner should not have to click anything".
 *
 * <h3>Why status is server-side</h3>
 * Firing is decided from the plan plus recorded task status. Kept only in the
 * browser, a reload would re-fire a session the learner just finished, and a
 * second tab would fire it again alongside the first.
