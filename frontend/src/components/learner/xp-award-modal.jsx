 *
 * Hosted once at the app root rather than per page. The assessment flow
 * navigates to the results page immediately after submitting, and a modal
 * owned by the submitting page would unmount mid-animation.
 *
 * One host, one queue, for every kind of payoff. A lesson can pay XP *and*
 * unlock an achievement in the same submit; two independently-hosted dialogs
 * would then both open and fight over the overlay, so they take turns here
 * instead -- "keep going" advances to the next card.
