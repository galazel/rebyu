/**
 * The Active Recall session: a paper built from what this learner keeps getting
 * wrong, opened without them having to go and find it.
 *
 * <p>The exam is minted on open and then handed to the ordinary attempt runner
 * at {@code /learner/assessments/:examId}. Recreating a question-answering UI
 * here would mean a second implementation of autosave, grading, timing and
 * every question type -- and the one place a learner sits an exam should be the
 * same place whatever put it in front of them.
 *
 * <p>It is minted rather than pre-built because the selection is only true at
 * the moment it is asked for: a paper assembled last week would re-test
 * mistakes the learner has since fixed and miss the ones they have since made.
