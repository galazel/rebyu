/**
 * The learner's gamification counters, in the portal header.
 *
 * Two numbers only: the streak they do not want to break, and the XP they are
 * accumulating. Coins and AI credits are balances you spend deliberately from
 * the page that spends them, not things you glance at between lessons — in the
 * header they were two more numbers competing with the two that drive study.
 * Both lived only on the dashboard before, which meant the streak was invisible
 * on every page where breaking it was actually a risk.
 *
 * Each counter is an icon *and* a number. The icon is what makes them scannable
 * in a 16px-tall strip, and each keeps a text label in its tooltip and its
 * accessible name, so the icon is never the only carrier.
 *
 * XP comes from the portal payload the layout has already fetched, so it costs
 * no extra request. Only the streak needs its own call.
