/**
 * Numbered problem *roadmap* shared by CodeStrike and Blueprint Arena.
 *
 * Drawn as a road, not a rule: a thick carriageway with a dashed centre line
 * that snakes across the frame and switches back at each end, with the problem
 * nodes hung off it on short stems. A run is an ordered journey, and the road
 * is the only element on the page that says so — a block of numbered tiles, or
 * a hairline with circles on it, communicates none of that order.
 *
 * The serpentine matters as much as the thickness. The path used to be one long
 * left-to-right wave that ran several screens wide, so the shape of the run was
 * never visible at once and you scrolled to find your place. Wrapping it into
 * rows joined by U-turns puts the whole route in one frame: you can see how far
 * it goes, and where you are on it, without moving anything.
 *
 * Horizontal roadmap on web, single vertical road on mobile — each picks the
 * axis with room, rather than squeezing switchbacks onto a phone.
 *
 * States are carried by colour *and* an icon, so the run never depends on
 * colour alone. Locked nodes stay on the road rather than being hidden — seeing
 * how far it goes is part of what makes it read as an endurance run.
