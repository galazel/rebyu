/* React Query's own defaults are staleTime 0 and refetchOnWindowFocus true,
   which means every cached read is considered stale the instant it lands: going
   back to a page you were just on refetches it in full, and so does alt-tabbing
   away and back. Against this API -- whose database is a Neon instance in
   ap-southeast-1, ~50ms per round trip -- that turns navigation the cache could
   answer instantly into a fresh wait, every time.

   Thirty seconds is short enough that nothing on screen is meaningfully out of
   date and long enough to cover the navigation the learner is actually doing:
   opening a lesson and coming back, checking analytics and returning to the
   dashboard. It changes nothing about correctness, because the things that MUST
   be current are not left to a timer -- submitting an assessment, completing a
   lesson and every other mutation invalidate their queries explicitly, which
   refetches regardless of staleness. The seventy-odd queries that already set
   their own staleTime keep it; this is only the floor for the ones that did
   not.

   Assessment answers, scores, attempts and results are never served stale by
   this: an attempt's result is immutable once written, and the in-progress
   attempt is server-owned state read once at start rather than polled. */
