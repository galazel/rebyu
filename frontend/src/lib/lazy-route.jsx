/**
 * Route-level code splitting that survives a deploy.
 *
 * Every route in this app is a lazily imported chunk whose filename carries a
 * content hash, so a deploy replaces `learner-layout-Dw_vzAVY.js` with a file
 * of a different name. A browser that already has the old `index.html` open
 * goes on asking for the old names: mid-deploy those requests are reset, and
 * afterwards they are simply gone. React's `lazy` turns that into a thrown
 * promise rejection, and with no error boundary above it the whole route tree
 * unmounts -- the learner is left looking at a white page, with the failure
 * only visible in the console. It does not recover on its own, because
 * nothing retries and nothing tells them to reload.
 *
 * The fix is in two halves, and both are needed: this file retries the import
 * once and then reloads the page, and `RouteErrorBoundary` catches whatever
 * gets through so the worst case is a panel with a button rather than nothing
 * at all.

 * taken as a stale document, which a reload fixes by fetching the new
