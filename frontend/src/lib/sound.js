 * licence to honour for a sound someone else recorded, no network request at
 * the exact moment the learner is being congratulated, and nothing to break
 * offline. It also means the chime can be tuned by editing numbers rather than
 * by sourcing a new file.
 *
 * Everything below fails silently. A browser that blocks audio, a device with
 * no output, a `AudioContext` the autoplay policy refuses to resume — none of
 * those are errors the learner needs to hear about, and an unlockable
 * achievement that throws because a sound could not play would be a far worse
 * bug than a missing sound.
