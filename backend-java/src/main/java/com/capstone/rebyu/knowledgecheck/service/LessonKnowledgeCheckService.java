/**
 * The pop-up knowledge check: five questions drawn from lessons this learner has
 * already finished, served while they are part-way through reading a different
 * one.
 *
 * <h3>Why it is a real exam</h3>
 * The same reason {@code RecallExamService} mints one. A check can contain any
 * question type the bank holds -- multiple choice, true/false, short answer,
 * descriptive, programming, diagram -- and the graders for those live in the
 * attempt engine, keyed off {@code AssessmentAttempt}. Hand-rolling a second
 * scoring path here would mean reimplementing exact-match and AI-semantic short
 * answer, rubric-graded descriptive, Judge0 programming and structural diagram
 * marking, and then keeping all five in step with the originals forever.
 * Minting the exam means grading, XP, the lesson breakdown and the BKT mastery
 * events all apply unchanged.
 *
 * <h3>What gets picked</h3>
 * Only lessons the learner has actually completed, preferring the certification
 * they are currently reading, and never the lesson they are reading right now --
 * a check is recall of finished material, and quizzing someone on the page in
 * front of them is a reading-comprehension test instead.
 *
 * <p>Within that pool the questions are chosen weakness-first: anything the
 * learner has previously answered incorrectly, on any submitted assessment,
 * worst-missed first. The question bank fills whatever is left. See
 * {@link #selectQuestions} for why.
