/**
 * Clears everything hanging off a curriculum node so the node itself can go.
 *
 * Deleting a major category, a module, or a lesson used to be impossible in
 * practice. The only editor was the certification drawer, which rebuilt the
 * whole tree through {@code PUT /certifications/{id}} and left JPA's
 * {@code orphanRemoval} to drop whatever was missing -- but every foreign key
 * into {@code lessons}, {@code middle_categories} and {@code major_categories}
 * is NO ACTION, and a generated lesson always has an exam and a stack of
 * questions pointing at it. The delete died on a constraint violation before it
 * removed anything.
 *
 * <p>So a node's own content is removed here first, in dependency order, and
 * the caller then deletes the node through JPA as normal (which cascades the
 * tree beneath it, plus a lesson's images and videos).
 *
 * <h2>What is deleted and what refuses</h2>
 *
 * Authored content -- exams, questions, choices, the per-type question configs
 * -- is the admin's own material and goes without asking. Derived learner
 * progress (a read section, a completed-lesson mark, a saved library item)
 * goes too: it is a pointer at content that is about to stop existing, and
 * keeping it leaves rows describing a lesson nobody can open.
 *
 * <p>Graded records are different, and they stop the delete: an attempt, a
 * result, or an answered exam question is something a learner or the
 * institution that bought the certification is entitled to keep, and no
 * curriculum edit should be able to erase it. Those cases raise
 * {@link BusinessRuleException.CurriculumNodeInUseException} with the count, so
 * the admin is told what is in the way rather than being given a failed
 * request.
