 * Learning statistics for one institution: a roster-wide rollup plus a row per
 * member.
 *
 * Every figure is derived from the institution's own assignments, attempts and
 * completed lessons -- nothing here is sampled or projected. A member with no
 * activity yet reports nulls for the score fields rather than zeros, because
 * "has not been graded" is not the same fact as "scored zero" and the dashboard
 * must not draw them the same way.
