/**
 * The learner's study plan, for one certification or across all of them.
 *
 * <p>A null {@code certificationId} is the overall plan -- one schedule covering
 * everything the learner is enrolled in, built from the analytics page. It is
 * optional: nothing requires a learner to have one, and it neither replaces nor
 * is replaced by the per-certification plans.
 *
 * <p>The schedule itself is built in the browser (see the study-plan generator:
 * it turns the diagnostic's priority topics, the target exam date, and the
 * chosen study days into dated events). This service is where that result is
 * kept, which is the whole difference between a plan and a form the learner
 * filled in once -- before this it lived in React state and was gone on
 * reload, and the stub here saved an empty {@code "{}"} schedule.
