     * Hibernate {@code ddl-auto: update} (see SchemaDefaultsSeeder), and a
     * Hibernate-generated foreign key carries no ON DELETE rule -- so V24's
     * cascade does not exist here and deleting a commented post fails with 23503.
     *
     * <p>One statement matters. Postgres checks a NO ACTION key at the end of the
     * statement, so removing a comment and the reply pointing at it together is
     * fine, where row-by-row deletes would trip over their own ordering.
     *
     * <p>Callers must authorise BEFORE calling: the data-modifying CTEs run
     * regardless of whether the final DELETE matches a row.
